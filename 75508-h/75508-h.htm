<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“To have what we want is riches; but to be able to do without it is power.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>But</span> the extraordinary thing is that it
has happened!” The lady who seemed a
victim of this surprise lay back in her luxurious
chair and exhibited a small foot on
the fender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Black velvet slippers,” said her companion
critically, “on a brass fender are
really, my dear, a poem. Where do you
learn these things? Poor Muriel, her feet
were always rather large!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She had everything in her favor,” said
Mrs. le Mentier, the first speaker. “Money,
position, a face and figure one could do a
good deal with. She was simply ruined by
her earnestness. I have often said to her,
‘Well, Muriel, why don’t you take up the
Church?’ But she never did; she said it
was too comfortable and that it would
crush her. I’m sure she’s not too comfortable
now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Huntly rose and went to the window.
It was raining dismally, with a constant reiterated
drip, drip on the tiles. She turned
back, shivering a little, to the cosey boudoir
of her friend with whom she had just been
lunching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I often wonder,” she said thoughtfully,
“if it wasn’t Jack Hurstly after all. You
know I had them last summer with me; and
though poor Muriel always managed things
very well, there were times—— And then
he went off suddenly, you know; and she
said she couldn’t imagine what I could see
in him, though I know for certain she bore
with that brutal bull-terrier of his, and pretended
to like it, while all the time she
loathed animals—dogs especially.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” said Mrs. le Mentier; “and she’s
really dropped out—one can’t do anything!
All the time when she isn’t actually at that
tiresome Stepney club of hers she’s contriving
things for it—positively it amounts
to a terror! She asked me last week to sing
at a smoking concert for some factory
hands. I told her I thought smoking concerts
for those kind of people were simply
immoral, and she actually flamed up and
cried, ‘You sing for Captain Hurstly and
his do-nothing friends, who can afford to
amuse themselves, and you won’t sing for
men whose daily life is a hell, and whose
only amusements are unspeakably degrading!’
Of course I stopped her at once. I
told her she should give them Bible lessons.
She saw how silly she had been then, and
laughed in that dear old way of hers,
and said, ‘You always had such a lot
of common sense, Edith!’ But you see
she must be dropped. She’ll begin to
talk about her soul next!” Her friend
yawned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my dear,” she said, “don’t you
get earnest too. That wretched Madame
Veune is coming to fit me at three o’clock,
so I must be off. Oh, by-the-bye, if Muriel
should turn up to-morrow you might ask
her to come and see me—I don’t know her
slum address—one must do what one can,
you know. Good-bye, dear.” And the
two affectionately kissed and parted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Huntly frowned as she drove home.
Muriel Dallerton had been an old friend of
hers, and she really meant to do what she
could for her.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER II</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote20em'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“The sky is not less blue because the blind man cannot
see it.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Muriel Dallerton</span> knelt on the floor of a
small lodging-house room by the fire. It
was with evident difficulty that she could
make it burn at all, for the soot kept rolling
down and the chimney threatened to smoke.
She had not yet accustomed herself to black
hands every time she touched the shovel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The worst of it was she expected her
uncle and guardian to tea, and she had to
confess to herself that the prospect was not
pleasing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had lived with her uncle ever since
she had been an orphan at six years of age,
and she had been sent to an expensive
boarding-school and been finished in Paris.
After three triumphant London seasons,
every moment of which she had lived
through with the same earnest delight that
was one of her most striking characteristics,
she had come to the conclusion that in some
way or other she was wasting her life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had for a whole year tried every way
of doing good that was compatible with a
house full of servants, a stable full of horses,
and a social position. But at every turn
she met with opposition—this, that, the
other was “not nice”—not “the proper
thing”—the horses couldn’t go out—what
would the servants think—she was upsetting
the whole house—people would begin
to talk. She confessed herself lamentably
deficient in the sense of what was the
proper thing, and on her own side she felt
she could no longer bear the strain of the
double life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was needed all day at the club. She
had organized games, classes, recitations,
employments and entertainments for men,
women and children, and all needed her
personal supervision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not that she was not fond of
pleasure—she had immense capacities for
enjoyment. She was known by all her acquaintances
as that “radiant Miss Dallerton”—only
to <span class='it'>live</span> for pleasure that was
different, and little by little she found herself
“dropped out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Society is very exacting: it demands the
whole heart and constant attendance at
its haunts, so that when Muriel Dallerton
finally announced her intention of going to
live in a model tenement next to her club,
society was careful to make plain to her
that reluctantly, and with all due respect
for her ten thousand a year, until she returned
to her senses and her west-end
house, society must pass her by on the
other side. Her uncle, Sir Arthur Dallerton,
felt deeply what was generally termed
her “extraordinary attitude”—it cast a reflection
upon him. He missed her gracious
household ways, the little attentions with
which she had surrounded him. He had,
it is true, neglected her atrociously; but up
till now she had always, as he framed it,
“done her duty by him.” Her living away
from him was a positive slur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Arthur Dallerton was coming this
afternoon to shake her resolution, and he
had no doubt whatever of his success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel tussled with the fire, which finally
consented to burn, then she rose to her feet,
brought out some tea-things, and began to
toast a muffin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bunch of daffodils in a cracked vase did
much to improve the appearance of the
room; a touch here, and there finished it;
and she had scarcely taken off her outdoor
things and washed her hands (very unused
to the work they had been put to) when a
dismal slavey announced, “A genelman to
see yer, miss,” and backed almost on to the
gentleman in question, who with an exclamation
of disgust pushed past her into
the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Muriel,” he said, “this is disgraceful!”
He paused as she ran forward
to meet and relieve him of his hat and
umbrella. She looked up at him, her face
beaming with smiles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear,” she laughed, “did the blackbeetle
quite crush you? How horrid! But
now you’ll sit down here and have some
tea. You needn’t insult that chair by
doubting it. It will bear anything I know—I
saw the landlady sit on it, and nothing
happened!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her uncle sat down gingerly. “Were
those people,” he said coldly, “down in
what I can only call a yard—a <span class='it'>yard</span>, Muriel!—the
people you imagine you have a
mission amongst?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel poured out the tea. “They look
as if they needed it, don’t they, dear?” she
said, handing him a cup. “There, you’ve
got a <span class='it'>whole</span> handle, and only two chips
round the rim! Yes, those were some of
my people. I hope they weren’t in your
way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are extremely in my way, Muriel—extremely;
I may say I am greatly inconvenienced
by them. I suppose you realize
that I am alone in the world; and yet you
seem to imagine that your duty is to be
among these unpleasant characters in filthy
slums instead of at home looking after my
comfort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel smiled a little to herself as she
thought of the array of servants the great
house held, of the friends and cronies at the
club, where he spent the greater part of his
time. “His comfort!”—surely there were
enough people in the world already looking
after that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle Arthur,” she said, “we’ve talked
all this out before, haven’t we? We don’t
see it quite in the same light. I am very
sorry you are not comfortable. If the servants——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Muriel,” he interrupted in a raised
voice, “how dare you mention servants to
me! Do you imagine that when I refer to
comfort I mean personal attendance? You
have never had any heart! Mine has always
been an essentially affectionate nature. It
is domestic companionship that I desire;
and now that you are of an age to be of
some comfort to me, you fly off to—Heaven
knows where!—and throw me back
on the servants!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel sighed gently and laid her hand
on his. “Dear uncle, you have always been
so good to me. But you see you weren’t
always at home, and a girl nowadays isn’t
satisfied simply in being domestic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should scarcely have imagined <span class='it'>you</span>,
my niece Muriel, accusing me of neglect!
You invariably lose your temper upon these
subjects, which proves that you feel yourself
to be in the wrong. You know perfectly well
that you can have any woman you want
to live with you as lady companion, but
you’re so independent and obstinate——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That no one would live with me if you
asked them,” she finished merrily. “Ah!—but
please don’t talk about this any more,”
she pleaded as he strove to begin again.
“We shall never agree! I must have my
work to do. I cannot be happy without it,
and I cannot do it at home. But I only ask
for nine months of it. It is April now, and
in July you shall have me back for three
whole months, and do just what you like,
dear. Isn’t that a splendid bargain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tea was very nice, and the buttered
muffins especially were done to a turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Arthur Dallerton crossed his legs and
leaned back in his chair (forgetful of its
former occupant). “My dear,” he said
mildly, “what will people say? Have you
ever thought of that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear uncle,” said Muriel, smiling;
“I have thought of it, and I have come to
the conclusion that I had better not think
about it any more. Won’t you have some
more muffin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Arthur Dallerton graciously accepted
another piece. It did not occur to him
that Muriel had eaten nothing—those sort
of things never did occur to him. If it
had done so he would have put it down
to hysteria—the one great refuge for the
selfish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. le Mentier,” he pursued, “who is a
very sensible woman, told me what people
were saying, and I think you ought to know
of it too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel rose and looked out of the window.
It was still raining heavily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” she said a little wearily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They say this is a mere whim of yours
to bring Jack Hurstly to book.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl by the window stood quite still.
She did not see the children in the yard
below playing cheerfully in the gutter; she
did not even notice one of her most hopeful
cases reel across the court in a condition
which would have filled her soul with pity
and disgust two minutes before. Her uncle
thought her cold and indifferent, or possibly
sullen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes!” he said bitterly, “that is the sort
of thing, Muriel, that your conduct forces
me to put up with.” Muriel faced him
suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. le Mentier,” she said quietly,
“is——” she paused, “is very much mistaken
if she thinks such absurd rumors
have power to affect me; and I do not think
you need be put out by what she says, for
nobody who knows either Captain Hurstly
or myself would believe her.” Her uncle
rose to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem to be in a very bad temper,
Muriel,” he said. “I knew what would be
the result of your taking up this work. But
it’s very depressing to <span class='it'>me</span>. I shall go home—when
you come to a proper frame of
mind, let me know.” She ran forward and
kissed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But <span class='it'>you</span> do love me, don’t you?” she
whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, Muriel, if you would only
give up your absurd whim.” She drew
back a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mind the stairs,” she laughed; “and oh,
whatever you do, don’t tread on the blackbeetle.”
She watched him cross the yard,
and bowl off in a hansom. Somehow she
felt very forlorn and lonely all by herself.
She was startled to feel a tear-drop on her
hand. “Nonsense!” she said; “it’s time
for the girls’ cooking class!” She gave herself
a little shake and put on her things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She found herself saying as she left the
room, “If Jack thinks so I’ll never, never
speak to him again.” She was a little impatient
at the cooking class.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER III</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote20em'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“And custom lies upon thee with a weight: heavy as
frost, and deep almost as life.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>You</span> are quite right in thinking I care
for her, Mrs. Huntly, and have done ever
since I knew her,” said Jack Hurstly, looking
hard at an inoffensive poker. “But
there’s no doing anything with her. I am
not earnest enough, it seems. She objects
to my club, my sport, and all my set. I believe
she even objects to my regiment. At
any rate she thinks I am wasting my time
here in England, and ought to be sweating
in some beastly tropics—Heaven knows
why!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you ought, Jack, so you ought,” said
Mrs. Huntly soothingly. “Muriel is quite
right. It’s positively shameful the lives our
society young men lead. A horse, a gun, a
club and a dress-suit, what a catalogue of
occupations! Can you increase it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well,” said her companion rather
sheepishly, “I’m no worse than the other
fellows, am I, Mrs. Huntly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Jack, she’s not going to marry
the ‘other fellows,’ is she? You had better
leave them out of the question; and if
your ambition is to be no worse than they
are you had better dispense with Muriel.
Go off and hunt somewhere, and then
come back and marry a girl of your own
sort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened. “Miss Dallerton” the
butler announced. Muriel came forward
into the middle of the room. There was
such a warm, gracious dignity about her
that people who had little to recommend
them but the external felt thin in her presence.
Mrs. Huntly greeted her warmly.
Jack said very little, but as his eyes rested
on her Mrs. Huntly thought that the hunting
expedition, if it ever came off, must be a
long one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so glad, so glad to see you both,”
cried Muriel joyously, “particularly as you
are neither of you going to ask me for soup
tickets! Dearest Mary, are you really well?
And what a comfort it is to see a pretty
dress! And won’t you please both tell me
all about everybody, and who has married
who, though they ought to have done
better? I feel so ignorant.” She sat down
by Mary Huntly, caressing her hand, and
looking with glad eyes from one to the
other like a child out for a holiday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my dear girl,” cried Mrs. Huntly
mournfully, “to think that you are out of
it all! It almost breaks my heart!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mary, how dare you! I came to be
pacified, and if I’m reproached I shall
simply turn tail and run away! You don’t
reproach me, do you, Captain Hurstly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps I should like to, if you gave me
time,” he said, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but I won’t, not for any such purpose—you
shan’t have a moment of it. But
who is this?” A young girl had entered
the room; she was dangerously pretty (it
is the only adjective one can use), and
she was perfectly self-possessed. Mrs.
Huntly introduced her to them. She
was a young cousin of hers, Gladys
Travers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Imperceptibly the atmosphere changed.
Mrs. Huntly and Muriel drew apart from
the other two, and Muriel could not help
noticing how perfectly satisfied Captain
Hurstly seemed with his companion, and
how well they got on together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she rose to go Gladys crossed over
to her. “May I come to see you, Miss
Dallerton?” she asked. “I want so much
to know about your work, and I—I like you
so much! Don’t think me frightful. I have
lived in the States, you know, and people
say all Americans are forgiven everything!
I do really want so much to know you.”
She spoke in quick, low tones, the expression
changing as the shadows on a pool
change under a light wind. She was very
appealing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but it’s dear of you to like me,” said
Muriel, smiling. “Please come <span class='it'>really</span>, will
you? You will always find me somewhere
about the club—Mary has the address.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned to Captain Hurstly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am coming with you, if I may,” he
said. The two descended to the street in
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re looking awfully dragged and
thin, Miss Muriel,” he said at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You always were so hopelessly rude,”
she laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know what I think about the whole
thing?” he said gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, it’s <span class='it'>that</span> which makes me tired!”
she sighed. “All my friends say just
the same. They won’t think how—how
hard they make it for me—no—not even
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even me?” he asked quietly. She bit
her lips; she was losing her head it seemed;
she must not do that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I take the ’bus at this corner,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we’ll go by hansom,” said her
escort. She smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You always <span class='it'>will</span> contradict me, Captain
Hurstly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will not contradict <span class='it'>me</span> if I remind
you that you used to call me—Jack?” he
ventured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hansom drove up, and Muriel put out
her hand to him. She unmistakably intended
to go alone, even though she had
let him choose her vehicle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may come and see you?” he asked.
She frowned a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m very busy, you know,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does that mean I’m not to come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might come,” she suggested suddenly,
“and bring Mary’s little cousin; she
can’t come alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can though,” he persisted. She shook
her head and laughed merrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mary’s little cousin,” she said as she
drove off, “or not at all!” And he never
went.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER IV</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote20em'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“What’s the use of crying when the mother that bore ye
(Mary, pity women!) knew it all afore ye?”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> club room, large and bare, with a bench
or two and one long table, was full of girls,
though at first glance you might not have
been inclined to call them so. They were
all so inexpressibly old. As they stood
talking in groups, large and broad, with
their frowsy hair and draggle-tailed dresses,
lifting loud, rough voices and breaking from
time to time into hoarse roars of laughter,
they could scarcely be called prepossessing.
These were the girls who had warned a
simple-minded lady Bible-reader that “if
she didn’t tyke ’erself orf they’d strip her”—and
they would have done it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Muriel Dallerton entered the room
the whole gang swarmed towards her in
greeting. They loved her. “She ’adn’t
got no nonsense about ’er,” “She was a
real good sort, and no mistake,” and they
showed their appreciation of her by rushing
from their ten hours’ work into the club and
paying with treasured pennies the tiny entrance
fees she exacted for the classes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To-day was cooking class, and from a
great cupboard were drawn two dozen
aprons, which they themselves had helped
to buy and make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel knew just what wages they had,
and never denied them the dignity of giving
a little, if they had that little to give.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two long hours’ class followed. To the
girls who were accustomed to factory work
it was mere play, and the pleasure and excitement
of seeing how Mary Ann’s scones
or Minnie Newlove’s pie turned out was
inexhaustible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not until it was over and the cooking
boards and utensils put away that
Muriel missed one of the number. Lizzie
Belk was a girl who attended most regularly,
and Muriel walked over to her mate to
inquire after her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mary Ann, where is Lizzie this afternoon?”
she asked. There was a titter of
laughter from the group of girls with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye will! will ye!” shrieked Mary Ann
in a sudden fury. “I’ll bash yer ’ead in for
ye, Florrie Stevens!” she cried to a girl
whose laughter was the loudest. “What
right ’ave ye to pass it on <span class='it'>my</span> mate? I’ll
tell ye, miss.” She appealed to Muriel.
“Florrie’s none so straight as she can
blacken poor Liz.” Muriel leaned against
the table, feeling sick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush, Mary, you must not talk like
that,” she said at last. “What is the matter
with Lizzie?” There was an uneasy
silence. “The rest of you can go,” said
Muriel. “Good-night, girls, go out quietly,
please.” And the girls nodding to her in
rough good-nature went out leaving her
alone with Lizzie’s mate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel crossed to her side and took her
hand gently. “Poor Lizzie!” she said
softly. “Poor, poor Lizzie!” Mary burst
into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’E ’adn’t ought to er done it, miss, ’e
really ’adn’t!” she sobbed. “She was
alwers a straight ’un, was Liz, an’ ’e
promised ’er the lines an’ all, an’ now——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is she, Mary?” said Muriel quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She ain’t got nowheres to go to ’cept
the ’orspital. They turned ’er off to-day at
the factory; an’ ’er father’s beat ’er somethink
hawful, miss, the blasted, drunken
sot!” Muriel still held her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we had better go and find her,”
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye won’t ’ave nought to do with the
likes o’ ’er, will ye?” asked the girl in blank
astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Mary; don’t you think Lizzie needs
help?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She needs it bad, miss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then that’s what we’re going to give
her,” said Muriel firmly. Mary still stood
where she was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye—ye won’t be rough on her, miss?”
she begged in shamefaced tones. “ ’E treated
’er cruel bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Mary, I won’t be rough on her. I’m
not angry at all, only so <span class='it'>very, very</span> sorry.
It’s such a dreadful thing, isn’t it? Poor
Lizzie, we must do all we can for her.”
Mary’s big hand tightened over the slender
fingers of their “wonderful lady,” who
seemed to understand without being told,
and never said more than she meant to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went out into the streets together.
Lizzie was not hard to find. She was in
a deserted yard near the factory, among
heaps of refuse and mouldered iron. She
had cried till she could cry no more, and
lay in a sort of hopeless apathy, with wide,
dull eyes staring straight in front of her.
Muriel knelt down by her side, and Mary,
with the unobtrusive delicacy many of
the poorest have, turned away for a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lizzie,” said Muriel, as if she were speaking
to a little child, “Lizzie, I want you to
come with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my God!” said the girl. “Oh, my
God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will come, won’t you, Lizzie?” She
put out her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you dare touch me!” wailed the
girl. “Who brought ye ’ere? Ye don’t
know what I am. Oh, my God! my God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know all about it, Lizzie, and you
must get up now and come with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They shan’t tyke me to the ’orspital, I
tell yer—no, nor hanywheres. ’Ome? I
daren’t show my fice there! D’ye see my
harm an’ my ’ead? Father did that, an’ ’e
said ’e’d kill me if I was to come back! Oh,
let me alone! Why don’t ye let me alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get up, Lizzie,” said Muriel, rising
briskly to her feet. “Get up at once. I
am not going to take you either home or to
the hospital. You are coming back with
Mary and me to the club, and I shall find
a room for you in my lodgings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, now, Liz, do come, lovey, do come!”
Mary urged. Lizzie rose dizzily to her feet,
and between the two they got her back
somehow—first to the club, and when they
had fed her they took her to a room next
Muriel’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The landlady did not say much. “If the
young lydy choose to look hafter the likes
o’ ’er, well an’ good, if not she could not
stiy, of course.” But the young lady did
choose to look after her, and to pay double
for the room as well, so there was no more
to be said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a terrible night. Muriel never
forgot it. She sat there holding the girl’s
hand and hearing the whole story—the old,
old story, told in all its crude, black reality
between gasping sobs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’E said as ’ow I should ’ave my lines,”
she groaned; “an’ now ’e says we’d starve.
But I shouldn’t care for that, miss—no,
I shouldn’t, if honly they couldn’t call
me——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, dear, no! they shan’t call you
that,” Muriel murmured. “What is his
name, Lizzie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, ’e ’adn’t er ought to a treated me
so—Gawd knows ’ow I loves ’im! No!—I
can’t tell ye ’is name, dear miss—don’t
hask it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you must tell me, Lizzie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not if I was to die for it, miss!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you tell me I can help you, Lizzie,
perhaps to—to get your lines.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, miss, ’e’d never forgive me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I can do nothing, Lizzie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl sobbed afresh. Muriel rose and
went to the window. Out of the dark
clouds the stars peeped timorously, as if
afraid to look down on the sad, sordid world
beneath. A church clock chimed the hour—twelve
o’clock—and from the public-house
across the way a burst of brawling
voices broke. It was illegal she thought to
close so late.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The candle on the washstand flickered
miserably. She went back to the bedside,
and with careful, tender hands put back
the heavy hair and sponged away the
tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lizzie,” she said, and it seemed to her
as if the whole of London stood still to
listen, “there is some one I love with all
my heart—I—I think I could forgive him
anything.” She drew in her breath with
a long gasp. “Now—won’t you tell me
his name, Lizzie?” she pleaded. The two
women looked at each other. The girl
raised herself on her elbow and stared as
if she were weighing the soul of the other
woman (she had forgotten she was a lady).
At last she sank back satisfied. “If she had
a man,” Lizzie thought, “she might understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s—it’s Hobbs—Dick Hobbs,” she
said. “Ye won’t be ’ard on ’im, miss.
They can’t ’elp it, can they? Not as I
knows on—an’ hanyway ’twere all my fault,
I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I won’t be hard on him, Lizzie.” The
tears were rolling down her cheeks. “And
now I’ll put out this light, and you’ll go to
sleep, won’t you? And to-morrow I’ll see
Dick and get a license, and—and everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, miss!” cried the girl—“not my
lines?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Lizzie! If you’re a good girl and go
to sleep you shall have your lines to show.”
Muriel left her. When she came back a
few minutes later she found the exhausted
girl fast asleep; her face was red and
swollen still with crying, but there was a
happy smile on her lips. She was only
seventeen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there are thousands like this—thousands,”
thought Muriel. “God forgive
us our blindness and their pain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly she felt very faint and dizzy.
She remembered she had had nothing to
eat since her tea with Mary Huntly. She
covered her face with her hands, for she
realized more overwhelmingly than ever
that she could never marry Jack Hurstly.
But though she had cried for the other girl,
no tears came now.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>A broad-built</span>, hulking fellow with a
coarse, brutal face shouldered his way towards
Muriel. It was one of the men’s
evenings, and she had dropped in a moment
to speak to the superintendent, and to give
one of the men something to take home to
his sick wife. When the man reached her
she led him to a quiet corner of the room.
She had never felt afraid yet, nor did she
feel so now; only as she looked at the
flushed, scowling face she felt a little hopeless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They said as ’ow you wanted to speak
to me, miss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Dick, I do.” She paused, wondering
how best to make her appeal to him—where
in fact was that spark of the Divine
she so passionately believed in, so seldom
touched, yet trusted that she touched more
often than she knew. “Lizzie is with me,
Dick,” she said at last. “Do you think
that you have treated her quite fairly?”
The scowl changed to a senseless, meaning
smile. Muriel felt her eyes flash, but she had
herself well in hand. “Do you think it is
quite a brave, manly thing to do,” she asked
with slow, quiet intensity, “to ruin a girl’s
life—a girl you pretend to care for—who has
trusted in you? Would you not be ashamed
of breaking your word to another man? Yet
you seem to think it no great harm to betray
a woman! A woman like Lizzie too, who is
only a child after all, and who kept so
straight. She is very ill indeed, Dick, and
when—when the child is born I think she
will die. Wouldn’t you call a man who had
behaved so to your sister a—a murderer?”
The man’s sullen eyes were fixed on the
floor; he shifted awkwardly from one leg
to the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see has ye ’ave hany call to
speak to me like that, miss. I ain’t no
worse than the other chaps I knows on.
I’d like to do fair by Liz, but I ain’t earning
enough to keep a wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should have thought of that before
you made Lizzie a mother,” said Muriel
sternly. “And now you will leave her alone
to starve,” she added with quiet scorn,
“after having taken away her only chance
of earning her living, and—and having done
the very worst you could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man said nothing; his face was heavy
with inarticulate rage; she felt that he
wanted intensely to knock her down. One
of his mates remarked to a group of men
that “ ’Obbs looked horful hugly.” It did
not occur to him though to walk away.
Suddenly her voice softened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dick,” she said, “you’re not that sort of
man at all—you know you are not. You
hadn’t thought of it before—that was all,
wasn’t it? You didn’t mean to harm poor
Lizzie so. And she loves you, Dick—she
wasn’t a bit angry with you—she doesn’t
blame you at all.” (It had not exactly
occurred to the man that she did. It was
a new idea to him that she had a right to.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And—and so I can tell her that you
<span class='it'>want</span> to marry her—will marry her at once,
Dick, won’t you, before—before it’s too
late? You will let me tell her that, won’t
you?” Still no answer. “I trust you,”
she said softly; “I feel so sure that you
have the makings of a good man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes were glued on the floor. He
felt more bewildered than angry, and still
obstinately clung to silence, which could
not, as he phrased it, “let him in for anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel took a rose she was wearing.
With a sudden impulse she held it out to
him. “I gave Lizzie one,” she said gently,
“one like this. Would you like to wear
it?” It seemed easier to take it than to
speak, but somehow he was impelled to
look at her. Her eyes were fastened on him
with a look he never forgot—grave, earnest,
truthful—as if she had weighed his soul and
was simply waiting for the proof of her
judgment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A voice he scarcely recognized for his
own growled, “Well, then, what if I does?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God!” she murmured softly.
“Thank God!” He waited for his answer.
She smiled at him so wonderfully that he
felt the tears rise to his eyes. Her own eyes
swam in them. “I will help you all I can,”
she said. “Now come with me to Lizzie.”
He followed unwillingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men by the door shouted something
after him as he passed. He did not hear.
He followed her clumsily with creaking
boots into a room that resembled nothing
he had ever seen before, though it was
simply furnished; and sitting in a large
chair by the fire was Lizzie. Her eyes
were fastened on the door with a dumb,
questioning look. She moved her lips as if
they were dry. Then she saw him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my man! my man!” she cried.
Muriel shut the door quietly, and left them
alone together. She felt suddenly as if she
could never feel hopeless again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>You</span> have not come to see me for some
time, Jack, yet we used to be good friends
once, didn’t we? One seems to have one’s

I have known dressmakers—but I won’t

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“<span class='sc'>Edith le Mentier.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Jack Hurstly read the note, written on
rich, heavy cream, a tiny, definite hand between
large margins. It all seemed very
familiar to him. Three years ago there used
to be a drawer full of them, though he had
burned them of course, he remembered, after
the scene in the garden. It had all been
very graceful and harmless, and he had
immensely admired and pitied her with her
dense husband, who shattered her dainty
little subtleties with a heavy word or two,
and “called things,” as she plaintively remarked
to Jack, “by their proper names, as
if things,” she had added, “should ever be
called by names at all, and least of all by
their right ones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he had met Muriel. He thought
of that first evening, and of her frank,
disarming look, and of how she not only
did not say things she did not mean, but
actually went so far as to say the things
she did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a change from a little winding
stream now here, now there, to a free, open
lake with its clear reflection from the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was natural that after this should come
the scene in the garden; what he could not
understand was this little dinner three
years afterwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Curiosity and Muriel’s wilful remoteness
prompted him to accept the invitation; but
he did so formally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith, when she read his letter, broke
into a little laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A joke, my dear?” her husband asked,
looking over his newspaper across the
breakfast table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not, Ted,” said Edith; “I
should never dream of laughing at a joke at
breakfast time!” Her husband returned to
his sporting notes—they seemed to him so
much easier to understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. le Mentier prepared to meet her
guests by dressing in Jack Hurstly’s favorite
color. It happened to be the one which
suited her; but it is possible she would have
worn it if it had not. It takes a woman
longer than three years to forget a man’s
favorite colors, and longer still not to wear
them when she remembers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gladys Travers was the first to arrive,
with Mary Huntly’s brother, a deeply
earnest young clergyman with thoughtful
eyes. “Cyril had to bring me,” she said,
smiling, “because Mary had a headache,
one of those horrid dark-room ones, you
know, with tea and toast. I don’t believe
he quite approves though of dinner parties,
do you, Cyril?” Mrs. le Mentier shook
hands with him sympathetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know quite well what you feel,” she
said in her slow, gentle voice. “It’s the
herding together of rich people to eat
brilliantly, while all the great half of the
world have no brilliance and no dinner,
and I think it is so good of you to
come. I’ve only just <span class='it'>really</span> one or two
to-night, so I hope you won’t find us very
worldly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cyril Johnstone had blushed at his
cousin’s speech, but now that his hostess
paused he said gently, “Mary was so very
sorry she could not come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Mary,” Edith murmured as she
glided across the room to welcome two
men who had entered at the same time—Jack
Hurstly and a young doctor, a man
of good family and even better brains.
“How good of you to come, doctor!” said
she, her eyes sparkling their most vivid
welcome. “One feels,” she said, turning to
the young clergyman, “with busy men like
you what a debt of gratitude one owes.
Now you, Captain Hurstly,” she added (for
the first time addressing Jack), “had, I am
sure, nothing to give up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything to attract, certainly,” said
Jack with a smile at Gladys, who was
glancing with laughing, observant eyes
from one to the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dinner was announced, and Edith, taking
the young priest’s arm, followed the rest
of the party. She was thinking it extremely
stupid of dear Mary to have a dark-room
headache, and she was talking to Mr. Johnstone
on the marvellous utility of Bands of
Hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said, glancing over the flower-decked
table, “it’s the name itself. Hope!
What a lot it calls up, doesn’t it? Spring
mornings, one imagines, and skies too blue
to deny one anything. There’s something
in the word which makes one think of
waves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because they break themselves on the
rocks?” suggested Gladys, “or cover quicksands?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a word,” said the doctor, smiling,
“with a very expansive meaning, and a use
even more expanded than its meaning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Johnstone looked across to Mrs. le
Mentier. “It’s one of the cardinal virtues,”
he said gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And they,” said his cousin, looking at
Jack, “always close a conversation, because
you see it’s so inconvenient to have to take
off one’s shoes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Johnstone looked shocked, and Edith
started another subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My husband,” she said, “is away—fishing,
I think it is. He has, poor man, a
deadly feud against all animal nature, and
he spends his time trying to exterminate it.
I must confess it seems to me rather a hopeless
quest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you English say,” asked Gladys
of the doctor, “that it’s strengthening to
the character?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor smiled. “More to the muscles
than to the character, I should fancy,” he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But isn’t it one of your tests of a character,”
she persisted, “in England that it
should <span class='it'>have</span> fine muscles?” The conversation
became international. Edith watched,
but took no part; she was listening to Jack,
who was not talking to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was instead appealing to Cyril Johnstone.
“Are you at all interested,” he
asked, “in those slum clubs?” The priest’s
face brightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Immensely,” he said. “My work is
there, you know, and so I have seen a good
deal of them. But of course you refer to
those under parochial guidance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain Hurstly,” Mrs. le Mentier broke
in, “is referring, I feel sure, to the sweetest
free-lance in the world, a dear friend of ours
who has thought it her duty to disassociate
herself from her home, and even to a certain
extent from the Church, because she thinks
she can, as the phrase goes, ‘reach nearer
to the people’s hearts’ that way. You’ll
admit it’s heroically brave of her. People’s
hearts give one such shocks when one <span class='it'>does</span>
get near them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A case of hysteria,” murmured the
doctor under his breath, “in its most patent
modern form.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gladys glanced lightly at Jack Hurstly;
then she said in a sweet, penetrating voice,
“There you are wrong, doctor. Muriel is
the most healthy-minded girl I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her hysteria may be confined to one
form,” he ventured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but you should see her!” said
Gladys. Here the voice of Cyril Johnstone
broke in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems to me,” he exclaimed, “the
saddest thing in the world and the most
useless. There has been too much talk
about the people’s hearts, too many missions
of sentimental women. What can
they give the people? Their need, their
crying need, is for the cultivation of the
soul, and it is we—set apart as God’s ministers—who
are called upon, and to whom
alone rightly belongs the unspeakable privilege
and duty of serving the poor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. le Mentier looked gravely devotional
and stifled a yawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack Hurstly looked at Gladys, who again
meeting his look broke out into a defence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And while the Low and the High, the
Broad and the Long (if there <span class='it'>are</span> any long,
or if they aren’t all long), quarrel as to who
shall help the poor, and how they shall be
dressed to do it, what are the poor going to
do? And why shouldn’t a woman, or even
a man for that matter, go down among them
and teach them how to live? What kind
of souls are you going to teach in wretchedly
uncultivated bodies, cousin Cyril? And if
you believe in clubs, why aren’t you thankful
for their work, even if the clergy are not
asked to take Bible classes in them? As
for Muriel and her poor, she’s taught them
how to smile, and I actually heard one of
them say ‘Thank you’ the other day. I
don’t believe an archbishop could do as
much even with his robes on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Johnstone opened his mouth to answer
her tirade; but Jack Hurstly, who had
been listening delightedly, clapped his hands
and laughed, and he felt that it was impossible
to argue against a joke. Mrs. le Mentier
rose to her feet smiling. She felt that
her dinner had not helped her much; and
she did not love Gladys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us leave the gentlemen alone, dear,”
she said, “to discuss our short-comings and
their dominion. It’s an entrancing subject,
I believe—when you can have it all your
own way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two women floated gracefully out of
the room. They were rejoined very shortly
by the men, whom it is presumed found
their points of view on “the entrancing
subject” too different for prolonged discussion.
Gladys and the doctor stood out
on the balcony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The balmy June evening filled with the
noises of the streets below seemed very
soothing to them, and their talk interested
both immensely, so much so that they did
not hear Mrs. le Mentier preparing to sing,
and only ceased when her low, sweet voice
rang out, “Life and the world and mine
ownself are changed for a dream’s sake—for
a dream’s sake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a simple song, but she sung it with
a quiet passion and intensity that entirely
captivated her audience. When the song
was over they were not ready with their applause,
and even the doctor looked as if he
had met an ideal. Edith sang again, and
they went home, all but Jack Hurstly. “I
must speak to you a minute, Jack,” his
hostess had murmured as he turned over the
leaves of her music, and for the song’s sake
he stayed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood in the middle of the room, her
hands held loosely in front of her, like a
child’s. “Haven’t you punished me long
enough—Jack?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Mrs. le Mentier,” he began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” she murmured, “Mrs. le Mentier!
Mrs.—le Mentier—Jack!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had before wished that he had never
come; there seemed now nothing else to do
but to wish it more strongly. She looked
so young and piteous, and her eyes were full
of a real emotion. The only ways left were
to be weak or brutal. The last alternative
would end the scene quicker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t seem much good, does it,” he
finally said, “to go over all this again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled wistfully. “Is it all over
then for you?” she asked. “Do you know,
it was silly of me, wasn’t it? I somehow
thought you might still be the same, and
the three years’ penance enough for the
past mistake?” She spoke with a kind of
strained slowness very pitiful to hear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Things have changed so!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Things?” she laughed. “How a man
falls back on the inanimate! Things don’t
change, my dear Jack, but women grow
older and men grow wiser—that’s all. Let
me congratulate you then on your increase
of wisdom, and you will be a little sorry—for
my increasing age?” He frowned and
looked at the door; she winced as if he had
struck her. “You want to go?” she said.
“Well, there’s one thing, my dear Jack, for
you to remember. If you should get tired
of your sweet firebrand in the slums, ‘things
have not changed,’ you will remember,
won’t you? And women don’t—so the way
is still open.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stepped past her to the door, but he
turned back to look at her (he often turned
back). She was twisting her fan in her
hands and trying to smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can always come back,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I’m not such a brute as that!”
exclaimed the man at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, aren’t you?” she laughed. “You
have your limits, then? I’m so glad! And
you had better go now, for I have mine
too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the door closed firmly after him
limits seemed to dissolve. She put the
fan down carefully on the table, and she
looked at her miserable face in the glass
with a vague, ulterior satisfaction, for even
if one’s heart was broken it was something
of a comfort that one looked distinctly
pretty in tears.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VII</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote20em'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“So long as we know not what it opens, nothing can
be more beautiful than a key.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> short June days soon came to an end,
and Muriel found them none too short, for
warmth can only be enjoyed by the luxurious,
and her life at present was anything
but that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If one plunged into the work and life of
the people it needed strength both of will
and body to carry one through its disillusions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was nothing in the least exciting
in the work before her—it was merely very
hard. Occasionally it was true the great
opportunity would arise, as it had done in
the case of poor Liz. But next to their
extraordinary infrequency came the swiftness
with which all the greatness evaporated:
their very sins were so matter-of-fact,
and the larger elements in life were
taken so unpicturesquely that they seemed
shorn of their solemnity, and then strangely
robbed of all “the trailing clouds” of mystery.
When a widow spoke of her dead
husband as “ ’E made a beautiful corpse, ’e
did—yer ought to er seen ’im, miss,” the
word died on her lips, and to look at a dead
baby as being “one less mouth to feed,”
jarred on all her tender notes of sympathy
by the crudity of its truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel wrote to Gladys, who, strange to
say, had come to see her alone, not once but
often, that she had never known “death
could be vulgar before;” and, though she
felt very worried at the thought of shutting
up the club for three months, she confessed
to herself her heart rose at the thought
of the long, easy luxury of house-parties,
country days, and even a glimpse of the sea.
People, too, who said a little more—and
meant a little less—she looked forward to
meeting with a positive sense of rest. Clear
black and white were rather glaring she
thought, and how life was mellowed by a
little mist! Jack Hurstly had never been to
see her. She had heard of him occasionally
from Gladys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Arthur wished her to come at once to
Blacklands, a house in a beautiful vicinity,
not too far from the conveniences of life;
and towards the end of July, very tired
and fagged, Muriel packed up her things
to go. There were many good-byes to be
said, but they were all over now with the
exception of Liz—Liz and the baby. She
had not seen either of them lately. As she
knocked at the door she heard the long,
fretful wail of a sick child, and then the
ungracious tones of a woman’s voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, it’s you, is it?” she added shrilly as
Muriel entered. “I thought you had given
us the slip. No, I ain’t been comin’ to the
club, nor I don’t mean to—nor Dick neither,
we ’ave ’ad enough of it, we ’ave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel showed no surprise. She sat down
and looked at the poor little baby tossing
disconsolately on its mother’s lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t he well?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ’e ain’t,” said Liz more gently; “ ’e
do take on somethink hawful in this ’eat. ’E
cries all night, and Dick won’t come nigh
’im. I’d a been a deal better off without
’im, that’s what I’d a been. What’s the use
o’ a ’usband who drinks all ’e earns? ’E
don’t do <span class='it'>me</span> no good, and I don’t do ’im no
good—we’re better apart.” She looked at
Muriel viciously in her increasing anger and
fear, turning on the first object she met.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re very tired, Lizzie,” she said
gently, “and very hot. Have you been
sitting up all night with baby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t keep no nurse!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor little thing,” said Muriel, holding
out her arms for it; “poor little dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’E’ll crease your pretty skirt.” Muriel
laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, tell me,” she said, “what do you
mean about Dick. Is he really taking to
drink?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lizzie forgot her resentment and poured
out her troubles, and so again the woman
in Muriel conquered. Yet she knew that
there would be no gratitude for what she
did. Lizzie only envied her—“her pretty
frock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She wrote to her uncle promising to go
down the next day. Muriel arrived at
Blacklands to be met by the footman and a
carriage. The trappings of a luxury she had
spurned seemed at present very grateful to
her. They belonged, she realized, to a class
of things one does not actually need, and yet
seems to miss more than even the necessities.
As she drove comfortably through
the village she was possessed by a complete
set of new faculties. All her old fund of light-hearted
laughter sprang again within her;
her quick, observant eyes (which she had
used more lately to ignore than to observe)
found beauties at every turn. She felt a desire
to sketch two cottages half lost in honeysuckle
planted with the most perfect effect
of naturalness under the old tower of the
ivy-covered church. The churchyard seemed
the most perfectly restful thing she had ever
seen. She longed to pick the hedge flowers;
to let the wind blow about her hair, with no
restraining erection to keep it in place; to
walk barefoot across the cool, green fields;
to hunt for birds’ nests in the wood; to
climb the hills at sunset time—in short, a
passion of longing to come near to Nature
held her; to forget all the many inventions
of the clever, brutal, unscrupulous mind of
man; to be once, for however little time,
one with the world as “God has made it.”
She found herself taking off her gloves, and
at that moment the carriage swept up the
drive of a large old house, with an exterior
too ancient to be quarrelled with, and an
interior too full of the best of modern
“improvements” to be in the least appropriate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gladys was standing on the steps. She
held Muriel in her arms. On the younger
girl’s face there was an almost passionate
welcome, and she tried to hide her eagerness
in laughter, chatting in graceful snatches
over a thousand little nothings as the two
girls went to their rooms. “Did Muriel
know that there was no one there but themselves?—everybody
was coming down to-morrow.
Yes, that abominable little flirt,
Edith le Mentier, and her husband with his
exquisite stupidity, a cloak which covered
all his other sins—in the eyes of his wife
at least. Mary Huntly, too, not Tom—he
couldn’t. These business men really
worked; but Muriel was a business woman,
wasn’t she—the dear Muriel.” Muriel declared
she only worked for the sake of enjoying
laziness. They went down to tea.
“That doctor, too,” Gladys continued,
“with an advanced sister with red hair,
cigarette and a bull-dog—at least I think it’s
a bull-dog.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it is,” laughed Muriel. “You
must retain something, however far you
advance, and the bull-dog does that for
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The doctor overworked, you know; and
the sister’s devoted. Then there’s Captain
Hurstly, of course!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why of course?” said Muriel quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well——” Gladys stopped, “don’t
you want him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my dear, I don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your uncle thought——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, when he thinks,” laughed Muriel,
lifting her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there’s a friend of his——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My uncle’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silly!—Captain Hurstly’s—a Sir Somebody
Bruce.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alec?” suggested Muriel, quietly selecting
some seed-cake. “I know him well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you?” said Gladys, “I scarcely know
him at all. What did you think of him?”
Her little air of indifference was beautiful.
Muriel sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s like the rest,” she said wearily.
“Splendid, capable, broad-shouldered and—useless.
I think if I were a man like that
I should use my talent as a good shot for
personal purposes; it would seem to me less
wasteful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but, Muriel, we girls we’re none of
us any better. You, dearest, you’re different.
And in America I was different too.
There’s so little strain in being happy there—so
little waste in pleasure. The rush of life,
its width and lack of limits, is a continual
occupation; but here there are too many
women. Some of them must be old maids.
It’s like the game of musical chairs. They
none of them, you see, want to be left out,
so they take the first place vacant. They
have an eye on their opportunities; they
make efforts to attain, and a masterly
mamma backs them. When you come to
think of it—their training, their suppression!
You can’t wonder they take their
first opening. But for women to be hunters—forgive
the naked, cruel term, darling—is
repulsive. Oh, if I had a daughter I
should drown her, or bring her up to something
more worth living for!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She walked about the room putting this
and that to rights. The housemaid had
done it before her, but the quick, nervous
movements delivered her of the tension she
seemed under.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something’s very badly wrong,” thought
Muriel, and aloud she suggested the garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The birds were making twilight magical
on the velvet lawn. They sat breathing in
the soft, rich air, heavy with the scent of
summer flowers, too utterly at peace with
Nature and the restful spell she can throw
at moments over the most tortured hearts
to do more than hush themselves into
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel was the first to speak. She remembered
long afterwards how startling
her voice sounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have something to ask me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!—no, no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something to tell me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s hard—oh, Muriel, dearest—dearest,
it’s hard!” cried Gladys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hard things are sometimes better
shared,” said Muriel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hardest and the dearest sometimes
can’t be,” Gladys sighed. “What can I
do?” she added miserably. “It’s so old
and stale, just the eternal wrong situations
Nature pulls about so, or man gets twisted
into! Mary, my cousin, you know, wants
me—wants me to marry. I’m dependent on
her, you see, since father failed in the States.
They had me educated in England, and they
ruined that for me—the steady setness that
might have helped me now—by the wildest
three years in America. Sixteen!—and their
world without barriers, where everybody
wants you to have a good time! No, I’m
not crying—not for that. It lasted three
years, and after the smash they sent me
here. Mary doesn’t know what to do with
me. I’m not her sort—I’m always getting
into scrapes. I seem to have got into the
nursery again, where there is nothing but
corners. I’m in leading strings to a—maid.
There’s only one way out of my nursery,
Mary says—Muriel, it’s open now—but I
almost think I’d rather throw myself out of
the window than make use of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel looked at her. “And is there no
other door?” she asked gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! not mine—somebody else’s, and—they’ve
got the key.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where does it lead to?” Muriel asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I don’t know. The most beautiful
place in the world, I fancy; but if it was a
wilderness it would be the only way for
me!” Timidly Gladys put out her hands,
and Muriel held them, drawing the girl
closer to her. She asked with wonderful
mother-eyes the question no words could
draw from her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said at last, “people made a
mistake when they thought the world was
large. It’s very small—one woman’s heart
can hold the whole of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Muriel,” the other gasped, “Muriel, do
you care for him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For Alec Bruce, dear child? No!”
Suddenly her hands grew cold, a fear seized
her, cutting her breath short and making
the silence strangely empty. “You don’t
mean him?” she asked very slowly as if she
were just learning to talk. The girl shook
her head. “You mean Jack Hurstly?”
pursued Muriel gently inexorable. The girl
caught her hands away and covered her
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Muriel! Muriel!” she sobbed. “I
don’t—I don’t care for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither do I,” said Muriel very coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you?—don’t you?” the girl exclaimed,
her eyes shining like stars through
a cloud. “Then, oh, dearest—my dearest,
give me the key!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel stood quite still smiling. She felt
as if she were having a photograph taken;
she must not move; she must try to look
pleasant—that’s what they call it. She was
still so long that Gladys looked up in wonder.
The elder girl drew her into her arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be sure to come out well,” she
murmured. Then aloud: “Little darling,
you have always had the key—mine was
only a skeleton one, and, Gladys, I never
could have used it.” The girl clung to her
shivering with joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, after all, you do care for him a
little?” Muriel said tenderly. Gladys lifted
up her eyes. They seemed much older—they
were so happy and so sure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you there was only the one way—the
one way in all God’s earth for me. I
think I should have thrown myself out of
the window if you hadn’t given me the
key!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t!” cried Muriel half sobbing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gladys smiled. “Dearest, you don’t
understand—you see you don’t care for
him as I do!” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” repeated Muriel very slowly and
carefully, “I don’t quite understand—you
see I don’t—don’t care for him. Do you
know, little dear, it’s getting rather chilly.
Hadn’t we better go in and dress for dinner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, to think of dinner!” laughed
Gladys. “How we do mix things, don’t
we? It’s too terribly material.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But of the two she had the better appetite.
Muriel had never lied before, and she
found it very tiring.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VIII</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote20em'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“A self-sacrifice that is thorough must never pause.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Sunday,” said Edith le Mentier, lazily
swaying her parasol, “does my religion for
me. When I hear the sweet church bells
chiming over the cow-laden fields I say to
myself this is a Christian country. Cows
and a church—certainly I, too, must be a
Christian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And your responsibility ends there?”
asked Gladys, who with others of the party
was dressed to go to the little church across
the fields.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My responsibility, my dear, er—Miss
Gladys—as you so deliciously call it, is never
at work in that sphere. No! I recognize
it at my dressmaker’s; I am crushed under
it in shops; I frequently come face to face
with it in the choice of a cook. Beyond
this,” Mrs. le Mentier put out a dainty foot
under a frilled petticoat, “beyond this I am
a rational being—that is, whenever it is
possible I persuade some one else to do my
effort-making for me. Captain Hurstly, I
want a footstool; dear, delightful creatures,
do go and do my praying for me; Sir
Arthur,” here she put her head graciously
towards their slightly embarrassed host,
“is going to stay to keep me company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Delighted, I am sure,” murmured Sir
Arthur, handing Gladys’ prayer-book which
he had been carrying to the doctor, who
stood grimly and uncompromisingly silent.
It was natural that after that Gladys and
Dr. Grant should walk together and Muriel
find herself with Jack Hurstly. Cynthia
Grant, the doctor’s sister, had not yet returned
from a visit to the stables with Sir
Alec. Muriel had not seen Jack for some
time. He was always large and masterful
(in the most calmly protective meaning of
the word), but there was to-day a certain
alertness and unobtrusive eagerness in his
manner that was new to her. They knew
each other well enough to be able to float
off easily into commonplace chatter. It
paved the way for all the important things
which lost their stiffness by being set in a
background of familiar banter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m having a holiday,” said Jack, smiling
down at her oddly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You a holiday! You look terribly as if
you needed it!” she laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been working rather hard, really,”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fishing is over?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Miss Muriel, but I’ve had a harder
job to tackle. I’ve been trying to get the
place at home in decent order—getting
cottages built and all that sort of thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were always so practical,” she
murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because, you see, the place has been a
little weedy lately, and as I am to be off
again soon I wanted to leave it in order
before I went.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hunting big game?” she suggested
indifferently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—yes, rather. You see there’s been
a little scrapping in India on the frontier,
and—well, I thought it would be rather
jolly to have a shot at the little beggars myself.
You see the regiment being at Aldershot
a fellow hasn’t got much to do, and so
I have joined—temporarily, of course—a
batch of men who are going out in September.
Do you wish me luck?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your occupations,” said Muriel coldly,
“always seem to me a little brutal.” Then
she glanced more kindly at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was disconsolately grumbling, “Oh,
I say now!” and cutting the heads off the
nettles with his stick. They were nearing
the church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I hope, Jack,” she used the name
with her old deliberate frankness, looking
him in the eyes, steadily and kindly, “that
you will have the best of luck. I can’t
tell you how glad I am to see you set to
work again, and make something of all
that’s in you—all I know that’s in you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He beamed with pleasure, though he was
still a little puzzled at her former sharpness.
“It’s awfully good of you, Miss Muriel,”
he said, opening the gate; “and you—you
must know that if I am worth anything at
all it’s all owing to you. And now that you
say you believe in me,” he drew a long
breath, “I think I could do anything—anything
in the world to show you you’re not
mistaken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel said nothing. When they reached
the porch she turned to him, and not looking
at him said slowly, “I am quite sure I am
not mistaken, Jack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The church was cold and dark after the
bright sunshine in the fields. In the
church she remembered Gladys, and forgot
to listen to the sermon. She and the
doctor walked back together and quarrelled
all the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was that still, impossible hour of Sunday
afternoon when the drowsiness of after
lunch and the distance of five-o’clock tea
combine to make inaction of one sort or
another absolutely essential. Sir Arthur
Dallerton, however, was uncomfortably wide
awake. His protracted conversation with
his charming guest contributed not a little
to the unnatural keenness of his feelings,
and with Sir Arthur Dallerton to feel
keenly was to be in more or less of a bad
temper. He saw Muriel out of his smoking-room
window, and beckoned to her to
come in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you doing, Muriel,” he
asked severely, “at this time of the afternoon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everybody is going out on the river
after tea, so I was seeing about the boats,”
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, Muriel, is the business of the
gardener.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like minding the gardener’s business,”
said Muriel smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” said her uncle gravely, “If
you would leave the gardener’s business
alone, and attend a little more to your own,
I should be better pleased.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean, uncle?” the girl
asked, sitting down opposite him with her
wide-open, unembarrassed eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I know that it makes no
difference to you what I wish—that I take
for granted to begin with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She moved her head impatiently; she
hated the way he had of opening any discussion
with injured personalities. He waited
for a protest, and not hearing one he continued
with increased vehemence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are now twenty-seven. You have
had plenty of opportunities to settle down
in life. I have never attempted to force
your hand——” A look in the girl’s eyes
suggested the prudence of this course. “I
must say I have been uncommonly generous
in overlooking your extraordinary schemes,
but I never dreamed they excluded marriage.
May I ask, Muriel—I think I have
a right to know—if all my hopes are to
be in vain simply through the obstinacy
of an untrained, selfish girl? Do you,
Muriel—I insist upon knowing this—intend
to marry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry you insist, uncle,” said Muriel
very quietly, though two bright spots of
angry color burned in her cheeks, “because
I am afraid I can give you no satisfactory
answer to your hopes. It is very improbable—if
you really wish to know—that I
shall ever marry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about Jack Hurstly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know to what you refer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought your objection to him was
that he didn’t stick to his profession. He’s
sticking to it fast enough now.” Muriel
winced. “And,” he continued with more
hope of success, “he’ll probably get potted
by a native, and then perhaps you’ll be satisfied.
You women who talk the most
about cruelty are always the ones to send
us poor devils to our graves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have never had any objection to Jack
Hurstly, and I have none now, but I certainly
am not going to marry him. If he
gets killed in India, as you thoughtfully
suggested, it will perhaps prove to you that
he is beyond your matrimonial schemes.
I do not believe anything else would,”
said Muriel, now thoroughly aroused. She
looked lovely when she was angry: the
gray eyes blazed and widened, the firm chin
became inexorable, and her nostrils dilated
like a spirited horse. Her uncle, who had
an eye for beauty, appreciated her appearance,
but was too vexed to remark
on it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gad! you have the temper of a devil!”
he grumbled in reluctant admiration; “but
if you won’t have Jack Hurstly, you won’t.
And on the whole you might do better.
What I want you thoroughly to understand
is I’ll have no monkey business with that
young doctor. I didn’t ask him down
here, or you either, for any such purpose.
If you had liked Jack Hurstly, well and
good. I wouldn’t have opposed the match.
He’s got blood, and he’s got money, and I
have nothing against him. But I have
set my heart on one thing if you won’t
have him.” He stopped a moment.
“Muriel,” he said, “you know my heart
is weak, and it’s very bad for me to be
opposed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel smiled; the scene lost its strain;
the gay voices of idlers on the lawn came
in through the windows with the after-dinner
grace of the “wise thrushes” in the
shrubbery. They all sounded so restful
and contented. But she—must she battle
till her life’s end? Tears of self-pity rose
to her eyes. Her uncle supposed them to
be signs of softening grace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My child,” he said, “Sir Alec Bruce is
a good man, and he loves you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has a good income and a good
family,” suggested the girl maliciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Arthur waved them aside grandly.
“I have set my heart upon the match,”
said; “my life is risked by a disappointment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel crushed her hands together nervously.
“And what about my life?” she
said at last. “But I suppose that doesn’t
matter,” and ignoring her uncle’s wrathful
exclamation she stepped out of the French
windows and joined the idlers on the lawn.
Sir Arthur waited a few moments for a
heart attack to come on, but as nothing
happened he also went into the garden.
But a few moments had dissipated the
group, and only Cynthia Grant remained
with a bull-dog and a cigarette. She
looked extremely unsympathetic, and
grumbling under his breath something
far from complimentary about advanced
young women he returned to the house.
A moment later Dr. Grant joined his sister
on the lawn. The bull-dog, appropriately
named “Grip,” looked wistfully from one to
the other. He knew it was impossible to
be at the feet of both at the same time, and
so with chivalrous courtesy he curled himself
up once more by his mistress’s side
and listened with heavily absorbed eyes to
the following conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you really mean to do it?” asked
Cynthia curtly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I hadn’t, why should I have come
here?” replied her brother, giving short
puffs at his pipe. “You know I feel awfully
out of this sort of thing—an abominably
lazy lot.” Grip, who with the magnificent
patience of the strong had long
been putting up with an inquisitive and
infuriating fly, now relieved his feelings
with a successful snap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cynthia laughed bitterly. “You won’t
get her so easily as that,” she said by way of
illustration. “And why should I want you
to? Has it never occurred to you, my
dear brother, that I might prefer you better
unmarried. It’s a slackening sort of thing
at best for a man, and we’ve always
roughed it together, haven’t we, Geoff?
Pretty cosily, too, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might get married yourself,” he
said gloomily. The girl suggestively lit a
cigarette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think so, Geoff,” she said with
a queer little laugh. “Has it never
occurred to you that I’m thirty, and
you’ve never been particularly keen on it
before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not now—but I think it’s a good
thing for a girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean for a man, don’t you?” He
looked at her quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not like yourself to-day, Sis,”
he said gently. “What’s wrong?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re trying to marry Muriel Dallerton.
She’s in love with Jack Hurstly,
whom she’s trying to marry to that emotional
little Gladys thing. Meanwhile, unless
they are all very careful, Edith le Mentier
means to play her own game with
them all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know Miss Dallerton’s
in love with Hurstly?” asked the doctor,
savagely ignoring the rest of the remarks.
She turned on him with mocking eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is interested in his conversation,”
she said, and they both burst out laughing.
Grip placed his head massively on her
hands and looked both question and reproach
at her. “His business, Grip,” she
said, “is to get perfectly rested, not to
tread on lazy people’s corns, and to see as
much as possible of the right young lady.
As for me, Grip”—she dropped some inconveniently
heated ashes on his pink
nose, which made him shake his head and
blink severely like a shocked old lady—“where
do I come in? Well, I have my
own little game to play. And here’s dear
Edith in a fresh pink gown. Let’s go and
meet her—she’s so fond of us both. And
you——” she looked back with a whimsical
tenderness at her brother, “just go down
to the river and find your young lady,
only for Heaven’s sake don’t glare at her
like that!”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER IX</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote20em'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“It is sometimes possible to say ‘No,’ but hard to live
up to it.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Muriel</span> had not in the least intended to
find herself alone with Jack Hurstly in a
canoe. It all happened so naturally that
protests and excuses were out of the
question. She looked rather wistfully at
Gladys in a larger boat, who was talking
with nervous gaiety to Alec Bruce, while
Mary Huntly in the stern looked on with
serene approval. Gladys would not look
at her friend, and something in the girl’s
manner and carriage seemed to denote an
intense displeasure, which, after her confidence
to Muriel, was not on the whole incomprehensible.
Muriel sighed hopelessly.
Circumstances, she thought, were against
her, and Jack was with her; she might be
stronger than the circumstances, but she
had begun to feel that she was not as strong
as Jack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really have changed my life a bit,”
he went on, as if continuing their last conversation.
“Do you know when you went
to Stepney, and I got to know about all you
were doing—how you gave those girls such
a good time and helped them in their homes,
and all that, you know—it made me feel
what a cheap sort of thing the life of the
fellows about town is, and how, after all,
there isn’t so very much in just having a
good time if there’s nothing else besides or
beyond it. I hope you won’t think I’m
talking awful rot?” he interrupted himself
nervously. She shook her head; she found
it difficult to speak; her hand dipped in the
water seemed to her a sort of illustration
of how impossible it was to grasp her treasure
even while it surrounded her. They
were singing down the stream the air of a
new opera, and that, and the trailing
branches overhead, would have made a
wonder of beauty if she had not loved
Gladys. “Sacrifices lasted too long,” she
thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so,” he continued, watching her
with eager, earnest eyes as he talked,
“while I was waiting for leave to go out
to India I started a sort of club at home—among
the tenants, you know. Nothing
much of a place—only games and a room
where the men can go and smoke and read
their papers in the mornings. And it struck
me that Miss Gladys’ cousin—am I boring
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Jack—Gladys’ cousin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That Parson Cyril Johnstone,” he explained,
“was really an awfully good sort,
and might help me a bit with the men—on
his own line, you know. And as the vicar
wanted a curate, it seemed to fit in rather
decently. I had no idea how awfully interesting
that kind of thing could be. Why,
now I know the men, and drop in to play a
game of billiards with them, you couldn’t
believe how jolly they are with me; and
many of them more decent, wholesome kind
of men than one’s own sort. I should so
much like to show you the place, Muriel,
and ask your advice about it. I’m afraid
I’m an awfully poor hand at managing that
kind of thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Cyril Johnstone knows more about
men’s clubs than I do!” she replied with
half-averted head. Jack smiled. He was
not used to Muriel in this mood; it was
more like other women whom he had been
used to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” he said, “Cyril Johnstone is
all very well in his way, but an unecclesiastical
eye might be able to suggest more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel quite sure,” said Muriel firmly,
“that my eyes will be able to suggest
nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They must have changed then a good
deal in the last few minutes,” said Jack
coolly; “they have always suggested plenty
to me.” Muriel looked up desperately, and
saw Dr. Grant on the bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Row to the shore, please, Jack,” she
said, “there is room for the doctor.” Jack
set his lips together firmly. He had no intention
of rowing to the shore for any such
purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry,” he said; “I’m afraid it’s impossible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must insist,” she replied coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please don’t, for I hate to disobey your
wishes,” he pleaded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You overlook the alternative,” cried
Muriel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Muriel,” he said, “you don’t really mean
it—I know you don’t wish it!” He knew this
would have been fatal with another woman,
but he counted on her sincerity. She looked
from him to the shore, and back again to the
softly shaded water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must ask you to do it just the same,”
she said finally. He turned the boat into
mid-stream, and they floated awhile in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the first time I have ever refused
to do what you wanted,” he said at last,
drawing a deep breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the last time I shall ever give you
an opportunity,” said Muriel coldly. But if
she had hoped to prevent further words her
hope was in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You told me once that you cared for
me, Muriel, but that I wasn’t worth marrying.
I have tried to make myself a bit
more so, and now you are not going to tell
me, are you, that you have changed your
mind?” She faced him steadily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t marry you,” she said. “Please
don’t ask me questions, Jack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I must,” he said frowning. “Why
can’t you marry me?” She was silent.
“You don’t love me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps I never did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense, dear, you’re not that sort.
Tell me the truth—you do love me?”
Muriel turned in exasperation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, then, if you <span class='it'>will</span> have it. I <span class='it'>do</span>
love you, but I’m not now or at any other
time ever going to marry you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had forgotten the other boat and
the river. A burst of merry laughter
awoke them to the fact that they had drifted
on a snag, and that the rest of the party had
been watching them for the last few minutes
from the opposite bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the doctor after all who rowed out
to their assistance and took Muriel home
after tea across the fields. Muriel was
desperate. Jack had found means to say
to her that he did not in the least believe
her, and that he was not going to give
her up. Gladys had found means of very
pointedly, though with exquisite intangibility,
expressing a state of mind anything
but pleasant to her friend. The constant
flow of bright, good-natured chaff, the
utterly superficial, pleasant brightness of
the boating party, gave Muriel a feeling of
weariness and age. She felt glad to be with
the doctor. He at least left her alone and
seemed contented to talk or to be silent in
an easy, effortless way. Perhaps it was because
in his profession a man “learns to do
his watching without its showing pain.” He
talked chiefly about his sister, and when
they got home advised her in an off-hand
manner “to go and lie down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I am not tired,” she cried, half
vexed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he replied soothingly; “still you
know it’s a warm afternoon; you would find
it restful.” Muriel smiled submissively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To tell the truth,” she said, “I think
perhaps I am a bit tired,” and she went
upstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour afterwards there came a soft
knock at the door and Cynthia Grant came
in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They told me you had a headache,” she
said apologetically, “and I came to see if I
could do anything for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s very kind of you,” said Muriel
gratefully; “but do come and sit down. My
headache was only an excuse for laziness,
and it would do it good to be talked to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cynthia sat down near the sofa, and after
a little conversation on general subjects,
began in abrupt, curt tones to tell Muriel the
story of her life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why she told it, it would be impossible
to tell, except that she wished to approach
nearer to the girl who had won her brother’s
love, and that such a confidence was the
most painful sacrifice it was in her power to
make. It was a strange story of how she
and her brother had studied together side
by side for their degree; of how she had
advanced even farther than he, till at
length, finding she was outstripping him, in
one magnificent burst of sacrifice she had
thrown the whole thing up; but how the
fascination of her work proved almost too
much for her, till in desperation she left
her brother altogether, and went to the
Paris studios to study art. Here she paused
awhile as if reluctant to speak further.
“You don’t know,” she said, “what it was
to have lived as I did, almost as a man
among men. It was only we two—my
brother and I—against the world, you know,
and it’s a hard world. After I left him—I’m
not going to tell you the whole story—there
was a man who was a very fine fellow, an
Englishman and an artist, and he fell in
love with me before he quite knew—well,
all the incidents of my life. Paris is rather
a place for incidents, you know. He wanted
to marry me. But, of course, I told him—and,
I daresay, it wasn’t an ideal story. At
any rate he told me he could not make me
his wife, and I care far too much for him to
be satisfied with anything else. So I went
back to my brother, and I have been with
him ever since. I help him with his cases,
and, as his practice is rather large, and contains
a good many poor people, I find
enough to do. Are you horribly shocked,
Miss Dallerton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you given up your art?” said
Muriel. The other girl went to the window.
She laughed nervously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Art?” she said. “I never look at a
picture if I can help it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And does your brother know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything; but it has made no difference.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder why you told me?” said Muriel
thoughtfully. Cynthia smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look as if people were in the habit
of telling you things. Besides—I don’t
know—it seemed to me as if you ought to
know the truth if we were to be friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope we shall be,” said Muriel softly—“I
hope very much we shall be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” said Cynthia as she went to
the door, “that if I had known you, it
might have been different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel puzzled thoughtfully awhile over
the rather grim pair she had come into
contact with. She had known very little
of that great wide world of professional
life. Society and the slums, though they
were a great contrast, were not, she thought,
so great a mystery. But though Muriel was
distinctly broad-minded for a woman, it was
impossible for her just at present to absorb
herself in abstract problems when her own
life presented such pressing personal ones.
Her first misery at Gladys’ jealousy and
misunderstanding seemed gone. To her surprise
she had begun to feel almost a sense
of relief. If she didn’t understand, it was
plain there was not so very much to worry
about. If one looks for too many things
in one place, the few things one finds lose
their significance. It is not one’s love so
much that gets dulled as one’s sense of
importance. The halo of expectation fails;
next time one’s eagerness goes with slower
feet, and is positively astonished if it ever
gets met at all. So that now Muriel felt
she had simply over-estimated both her
friends’ characters and affection, and that
nothing therefore remained but to clearly
make Gladys see she did not intend to
marry Jack Hurstly. Her responsibility
ended there she told herself, after that she
need not try to keep up this very unequal
friendship any more. As for Cynthia Grant,
she was a woman and old enough to know
what to take for granted, and how not to
be exacting.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Very</span> firm and self-reliant natures make
sometimes the natural mistake of under-estimating
the power of passion. Their full
self-control and constant watchfulness ignore
the possibility of the strange touch of
sudden lawlessness—the betrayal of the
blood. That one could be one moment
standing reason-bound, content, a soul at
peace, and in another swept over the verge
of thought into a sea of feeling, was absurd
to Muriel. Yet the swift flash takes place:
the world, like a curtain, rolls up, and all the
conventions, the safeguards, the stationary
landscapes, disappear! It was such a moment
which took possession of her the very
night that she had decided to give her lover
to another woman. The evening had passed
pleasantly, and the still glory of the summer
night drew the party out into the dusk of
the garden. Muriel slipped away from the
rest and wandered into a little wilderness
some distance from the house, wondering
how best to carry out her plans, when
suddenly all the blood in her body rushed
to her heart, for there beside her stood the
man she loved. It had been possible for
her in the calm of loneliness and heartache
to dispose of Jack, but now—the moon’s
gold and silver gliding through the clouds;
the thrushes calling heart to heart their
breathless rapture in a liquid continuity of
song; all the passion and the pain rushing
into beauty, thrilled and throbbing with the
heart of night—it was difficult to resist now.
And the stars, how they shone down on
love, each one a light struck from the royal
conquest of their queen, the moon! They
were enwrapped in that dream so boundless
and so limited which for one breathless
moment holds all the world can teach, and
then scatters and breaks into the hundred
lesser lights of life. A sigh broke the
charm, and Muriel, wondering, withdrew
herself from his arms, abashed and yet
elated at her defeat, so much more sweet
than any of the triumphs life had held for
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said Jack, smiling down at her,
“are you going to tell me that you don’t
care?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid,” said Muriel, “that it would
not be very convincing if I did. It seems to
me,” she added breathlessly, “as if before I
had been living only on the outskirts of life.
I did not know it was like that!” She looked
at him wistfully, and asked humbly, “Is it
quite right, Jack, do you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, my dearest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To forget everything; to see nothing
but the world a background, and that one
great avowal drowning all the rest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it must be,” said Jack. “Just
because it’s so powerful it must be meant
to be good—in itself, you know—only some
of us poor chaps don’t know how to use
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel shivered a little; there was dampness
in the air; the trees seemed to quiver.
She remembered Liz and the squalid scenes
where the power which meant heaven to
her had meant darkness and life-long misery
to the other woman. Had she gained the
world only to lose it? Jack wrapped her
shawl tenderly over her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must go in, little woman,” he said
practically. “Now you’re mine you shan’t
run any risks, not even summer ones. Shall
I speak to your uncle?” he asked her as
they neared the little artificial lights of the
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet,” she whispered hoarsely, with
a terrible fear in her eyes. Jack followed
her glance. It rested on a young girl’s face.
Gladys was standing close at the French
window looking out into the night—desperate,
wild, despairing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s something wrong with the
child,” Muriel said quick to Jack—“bad
news from home, I think,” for even at that
moment she knew she must keep the other
woman’s secret. “Let me go to her, darling—good-night!
It’s awful, isn’t it,” she
said, “to be so selfish and so happy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She caught her hand from him, hurrying
into the house. “It’s wicked, it’s
wicked,” she murmured, “to be happy at
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gladys called out over the approaching
figure, “There is a letter for Captain
Hurstly!” He came unwillingly forward
into the light about the window. Muriel
stood now with her hand in the girl’s looking
back at him. Gladys herself seemed unaware
of the touch. She was smiling painfully;
the “On Her Majesty’s Service”
seemed to demand attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack opened it, read it, glanced for a
moment to Muriel, and placed it in his
pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does it say?” said Gladys, and
Jack, so absorbed by its purpose and the
strangeness of the scene, never knew till
afterwards that it was not Muriel who
had spoken. He tried to make light of
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m called off sooner than I expected.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When?” They both spoke at once this
time. Again he only heard Muriel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fact is—well, to-night,” he owned
unsteadily. Gladys stepped quickly forward;
a little quivering light shone in her
eyes; she caught her breath and half unconsciously
held out her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m so sorry, Captain Hurstly!” she
cried; “and I wish you—I wish you the
very best luck in the world.” He looked
towards Muriel, but she was gone. He
met the girl’s eyes again. His own felt
unaccountably misty. Muriel was gone, and
this little thing was wishing him the very
best luck in the world. He pressed her
hands gratefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, thank you awfully,” he murmured.
“I think I’ve got it to-night——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, where’s that tiresome Jack Hurstly?”
cried a voice from the window. “I
left him my fan to take care of, and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got it here, Mrs. le Mentier,” cried
Jack hastily, stepping through the low
French window with the missing fan in his
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he drove off an hour later to catch
the midnight train it was Edith le Mentier
who, side by side with Muriel, stood at the
door to see him off. Looking back he saw
that it was with her he had left “the very
best luck in the world.” He had quite
forgotten all about Gladys. From her
window she watched him go on fire with
love and happiness. His last words rang
in her ears. She never doubted that they
were meant for her. He had no time to say
more then; but when he came back, not
Muriel in all her beauty, nor any other
woman, nor any other thing could ever come
between them again she thought. And he
would come back! The moonlight and the
soft fragrance of the dusky night, what
were they any of them but the earth’s
pledges to her that her heaven should come
again to meet that other heaven in her
heart?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have broken my fan,” said Edith le
Mentier to Muriel as they went up to bed.
“So stupid of me, wasn’t it; but at any rate
I was not going to let Captain Hurstly have
another one.” Muriel looked straight before
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another one, Edith?” she repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, stupid, didn’t you know men
were in the habit of keeping people’s fans
when they were—well, rather—don’t you
know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid I’m rather dense—good-night,”
said Muriel wearily. She stopped
outside Gladys’ door, but there was no light
or sound. “She’s asleep,” she thought, “I
won’t disturb her,” and went on to her own
room. It seemed rather strange to her that
anybody could sleep.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> morning brought counsel to Muriel.
She would say nothing. Jack would not return
for a year or two, and in the meantime
Gladys’ passionate little heart might have
turned elsewhere, or in any case the quick
pain of certainty be less. For herself she
turned her eager mind anew to the work
before her. Love acted as a spur upon the
discipline of her life; it made the dark
places plainer, and lit up with light and hope
the saddest mysteries. She was one of those
few souls in whom experiences can never
conflict or stand in opposition to each other.
She knit them link by link into a chain
binding her closer and higher towards her
ideals. She never thought much about her
difficulties until she came up to them, but
when she once faced them they helped her
afterwards. Edith le Mentier’s delicate insinuation
she had felt a passing disgust
at, and had straightway brushed aside.
Jealousy and suspicion need darkness and
a closed-up room; all Muriel’s rooms were
open to the sky and bright with sunshine.
Nevertheless when she looked at Edith le
Mentier she felt an uneasiness she could not
account for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The party broke up the next morning.
The doctor and his sister returned to town,
while the others went to various other
country houses, Muriel and her uncle going
to Scotland for the remainder of her holiday.
She was impatient to go back to her work,
and the month passed in making arrangements
and re-arrangements all involving
voluminous correspondence. She wrote to
Cyril Johnstone about Captain Hurstly’s
club work, and as it was under parochial
guidance, and various ritual stipulations of
the young man’s were agreed to by the
open-minded, slightly lax old vicar, he was
soon settled in deeply earnest and energetic
work such as the slow old parish had never
seen before. Yet, as Muriel soon saw, the
example of his stern habits and indefatigable
labor bore much fruit of admiration
and respect, though scarcely that imitation
which the zealous young priest expected the
doctrines he would have died for to bring
forth. He was not satisfied with Muriel’s
generous explanation. “It’s your doctrines
that have made you, and if the people
accept you, surely they are on the way to
accept the doctrines?” She returned a
week earlier than her uncle wished her to,
to encourage Jack’s “Parson,” though she
wrote to Jack that “your young priest
doesn’t at all approve of me. He considers
me a shallow society woman with a club
craze, and shakes his head over my unaccountable
friendship with you. He gave
me splendid advice the other day, and I’m
afraid I lost my temper with him, but the
gravity with which he regarded me as he
said, ‘My dear young lady, I am not speaking
to you as a mere man, but from my
priestly office,’ restored my sense of humor.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But no, Jack, I have a reason for wishing
our engagement private. If it were any
feeling of my own I would tell you, as it
is you must take it on trust as you do me.
Did you ever know Mrs. le Mentier very
well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel wrote the last sentence and then
crossed it out. He might think—— Besides,
it was so absurd. She felt angry with herself
for having crossed it out—it was so unimportant.
She was surprised that night
by a letter from Cynthia Grant, who had
passed out of her mind with the press of
duty and pleasure and life. Now, however,
she awoke to a vigorous interest.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“You will be surprised at what I am
going to ask,” the letter ran, “but I hope
that won’t shake you into the negative
attitude that it does some people. I’m not
going to tell you that I have any ‘religious
views’ (and you will excuse me if I say
that with most people they are little more—and
distant views at that), because I
haven’t; only it happens to please me to
work, and I like you, consequently if you
see any opening for a capable woman doctor
who can give free ‘instruction’ to young
women and practical help as well, let me
know and I’ll come to you. My brother
approves of my plan, and is going to get an
assistant.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;'>“<span class='sc'>Cynthia Grant, M.D.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>P.S.</span>—I am particularly anxious for interesting
tumors.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel thought for a moment, then
laughed, and wired back: “Please come,
plenty of interesting tumors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first day of October before the
two women settled to work. Life opened before
them full, arduous, engrossing. Around
them in teeming factories and crowded dust-yards
lived the people into whose lives their
own brought knowledge, health, horizon.
Year after year these sordid lives go on,
working until dead-tired they stumble home
and stand an hour or two in the close streets
full of the dangers and temptations of the
city; the holidays’ rough carnivals of over-feeding
and drinking. Death, disease and
sin the only breaks in the grim monotony
of passing years, and now slowly and gradually
the change was taking place. From
their work the young people streamed into
the clubs, and were taught little by little
lessons of life, courtesy, truthfulness, honesty;
and these not by confronting them
with strange virtues, but in developing their
own, generosity, kindliness and the marvellous
quality of “straightness,” the shield
of so many of the poor. Men found
billiards and other games, even cards,
though gambling was not allowed; they
could pass their evenings in social good
fellowship without spending their wages or
staggering home drunk. Their wives, too,
in another part were not less well cared for,
and their sons and daughters, kept out of
the streets four or five nights out of the
seven, were all the more inclined to stay at
home on the other two. More than all this,
living among them and sharing all they
suffered was a “lidy,” who if she had chosen
need never have done a stroke of work, or
given a thought to anything but pleasure
and ease and beauty. Though some of the
more hardened jeered at her for her sacrifice,
the greater part were drawn in generous
animation and gratitude into the work, and
even those who jeered left her alone and
would have fought any who tried to do her
an injury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You only touch the fringe,” Cynthia
said to her one day. “So what’s the use?
When you die it will all sink back again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know,” said Muriel smiling, “I
believe there is healing in the very hem of
His garment, and that all these children in
whom we start a larger life will in time
permeate the apathetic multitude. As for
ourselves, don’t doubt that when we die the
work will not go on. Truly I should be
very despairing if I dreamed that such tremendous
purposes rested on my shoulders.
We just fit in here, that’s all, and make
the room larger for the next comer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Humph!” said Cynthia dryly; “after
I’d made the room larger, I should prefer
sitting in it myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense,” laughed Muriel; “you would
go on to make an addition to the house!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My brother comes here to-night,” Cynthia
stated abruptly. “He’s going to bring
a magic lantern for the men, and show them
some of his Chinese slides.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so glad,” said Muriel gratefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you like him?” Cynthia asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like your brother? Of course, very
much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So little as that?” cried Cynthia laughing
wistfully. “Oh, Muriel, Muriel!” Muriel
colored and frowned. It was a subject
that visibly annoyed her, and which she
tried to ignore. Dr. Grant had been very
kind to the club. She had tried to believe
he was interested in the work; it was a little
baffling to find it hinted that it might be the
worker. Cynthia watched her carefully.
“Is there nothing besides the work?” she
thought to herself. She introduced the
subject of a meal, and Muriel laughingly
discovered she had forgotten her lunch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were writing letters at lunch time,
weren’t you?” suggested Cynthia.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>There</span> was a high west wind, and the dust
swirled in clouds at the street corners. It
was the kind of wind that never lets one
alone, and is constantly drawing attention to
the inconveniences of one’s clothing. The
clouds were the dull brown of approaching
rain, drifting in rags across the chilly sky.
Cynthia Grant, who had been all the night
before and half the day through fighting
over the undesirable life of a mother and
child, felt almost aggrieved that she had
saved them both. “What did I want to do
it for? The whole system’s rotten! Why
should it be considered mercy to prolong
the agony instead of cutting it short? I
don’t care for the woman; I hate the child;
and, even if I liked them both, I don’t think
their lives worth living. Why that drunken
brute of a husband, who is always throwing
chairs at the poor thing, should say ‘Thank
God!’ when I told him she’d live is a
puzzle; he could easily have got some one
fresh to throw chairs at, and the brat is
only one mouth more to feed! I feel far
more sympathy for that woman with ten
children who told me she had had ‘no
churchyard luck’.” She chuckled grimly
to herself, and looked with a tolerant,
amused gaze at the narrow alley, with its
children at play in the gutters, wizened and
old, with sharp, cruel, degraded little faces,
slatternly women at doors, and skulking
forms, that were scarcely human, lurking in
corners and in the wretched rooms that
were called “living,” a phrase more applicable
to the vermin that inhabited
them than the half-human creatures that
sprawled there. It was a bad alley, and
the tough knotted stick in Cynthia’s hand
did not look out of place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she thought to herself, “Muriel
must be impelled by some pretty desperate
attraction to give up her life to this sort of
thing. It will make her old before her time.
And as for the people here, her influence will
probably cease as most influence does with
her presence, and trickle off them as easily
as water off a duck’s back. As for me, I
suppose I might as well be <span class='it'>here</span> as anywhere
else—now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at the sky and wondered what
poets saw in it. It suggested to her nothing
but the need of a broom. She was tired out
when she reached rooms over the club, and
glad of the tea Muriel had prepared for
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel could not stay, for it was the time
when her girls came out of the factory, and
she must be ready to meet them. She was
in one of her merriest and brightest moods.
The gloom of the outside world could not
touch her; even the sordid misery of the
streets she had visited that afternoon only
seemed to her vistas of future sunshine.
She believed in no sympathy that stopped
at sorrow; but it was because she believed
so deeply in the reality of sorrow that she
knew the certainty of joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What makes you so happy?” said
Cynthia wistfully; “I see nothing to cause
it.” Muriel wrinkled her eyebrows as she
always did when puzzled. Geoff called it
her “frowning for a vision,” and compared
it to a sailor’s whistling for a wind. At
last the partial vision came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see why it should be so difficult
to be happy,” she said. “All that one
hasn’t got is bound to come some day; all
that one truly <span class='it'>has</span> will never go. And when
one is quite sure of that oneself, it is beautiful
to be able to encourage one’s bit of the
world to go on waiting for <span class='it'>their</span> bright side.
And how good and bright and dear things
really are if we only come to look through
them, and don’t make <span class='it'>culs-de-sac</span> of sorrows.
If love is the key of the world, joy
is the hand that turns it, I feel sure. To
make a creed of joy and a fact of love is to
win half the battles, and be ready to fight
the other half. But you know all this just
as well as I do, and practise it far better—so
what’s the use of talking? Simple things
become mysteries directly you try to explain
them. Mind you rest and sleep.
I’ll be back for supper,” and she disappeared.
It grew dark in the room afterwards.</p>

leaves it to a higher court to take account of Aims.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was decided that one more effort should
be made to rescue Muriel Dallerton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary Huntly, persuaded by her husband,
wrote asking her for two days early in the
season.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cynthia peremptorily ordered her to go,
and she went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weather in the opening charm of June
would to most people have been better
spent in the country; only London lovers
felt the greater charm of the full, bright
season set in the green freshness of the
Park.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a ball the first night, and
Muriel danced in a dream of delight at the
old easy ways, and all the beauties of sight
and sound and sense. Gladys was away on
a visit, so the return to civilization was
marked by no jar of severed friendship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A day spent on the river with one of
those groups, where each one knows his
neighbor well enough for associations to
make past pleasures present ones, and yet
not too deeply to be able to play lightly on
the surface of personalities, made Muriel
thirsty for more. It is true that there were
strained relationships even there, though
hidden with a cultivated ease; but she refused
to see them, and let herself be soothed
into a fairyland of fancies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary had arranged as a climax a tea-party
in the gardens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” she said apologetically, “one
knows they aren’t private, but it’s the best
place in the world to wander, if only on that
account. Wandering I always think the
chief charm of tea out-of-doors; it’s a compensation
for one’s hair being blown about
and the butter melting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It all depends on having the right person
to wander with,” suggested her companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, but what are all our social efforts
but an attempt to find the right person—and
then wander?” laughed Mrs. Huntly.
“It’s the magic lottery that makes London
seasons, and keeps up house-parties——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And finally limits one to a wedding
ring,” interrupted one of the group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or charms one away from the limits!”
ventured a daring young man to Muriel.
She felt vaguely uncomfortable, these children
of light played so near the brink of
things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think I quite know what you
mean,” she said gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t mean anything,” said Mary
Huntly shortly. The young man turned to
someone with whom he needn’t explain.
Muriel wondered whether she would enjoy
wandering in the gardens. “At any rate
I shall not have the right person,” she
thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the afternoon came the overpowering
youthfulness of spring danced in her
veins, and made it easy for the unpleasant
to pass from her mind. She was with a
little group who had not yet separated to
wander, when she saw a woman whom she
had known crossing the grass at a little
distance from where they sat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, there is Sally Covering,” she cried.
“It seems years since I have seen her!”
There was a moment’s awkward silence.
Muriel looked in astonishment from one to
the other. They all began to talk in the
way of people who wish to ignore an impossible
moment. Alec Bruce, who was one of
the party, asked her an irrelevant question,
but she brushed it aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to speak to her,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t if I were you,” said Alec.
They spoke rapidly, and Muriel felt the
color rush to her face. She felt annoyed
with herself for speaking at all; but now
that she had spoken she would not be a
coward, so she walked the intervening
space, and came up with the woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Covering! you haven’t forgotten
me?” she cried. The woman started at the
sound of her name, and turned sharply. She
was painted more than a little, and inartistically.
She gave a queer little laugh as she
took Muriel’s outstretched hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear me, no!” she said; “I am not the
one who forgets, Miss Dallerton.” Muriel
held her hand and looked into her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you will think me very rude
to stop you like this!” she said; “but I
should like so much to talk to you a few
moments, if you are not engaged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Covering withdrew her hand. She
was embarrassed, puzzled, and a trifle defiant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot think what you wish to say to
me, Miss Dallerton,” she answered; “but I
am quite at your disposal for the next few
minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked together in silence for a
moment, Muriel searching for the right
word. She remembered the woman’s story
now. She had left her husband, and made
what the set she lived in called the “dreadful
break.” Muriel could not quite remember
with whom; but people did not talk
to her much about that kind of thing, and
she had only heard the outlines of the
story. What Muriel finally did say was
not in the least what Mrs. Covering expected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have never been to see me,” she
said, “in my new home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I don’t see people now,” said Mrs.
Covering, with some bitterness; “I have
got out of the habit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Covering,” said Muriel, “I should
like to be able to contradict a report about
you. Will you give me leave?” Mrs.
Covering made an attempt to remain defiant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, Miss Dallerton,” she began, “I
cannot conceive——” But as she looked
at the girl’s honest, tender eyes her lips
quivered. “It’s no use,” she said. “Please
let us say good-bye here. It was very
good of you to speak to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it isn’t true?” said Muriel. Mrs.
Covering looked back to where through the
trees her old acquaintances in ostentatious
conversation pretended not to be watching
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, anyway,” she said, “I was honest
enough to leave my husband; if I hadn’t I
might be over there now with your friends.”
Muriel took her hand. She knew that sometimes
the human touch does more than the
work of words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you come to me?” she said. “Will
you promise to come to me when you want
help? That you will want help I feel sure;
for you are sad already, and you can’t help
being more sad. Only don’t get desperate.
Come to me, and we will find some way out
of it together!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not sad!” said Mrs. Covering quickly.
“I don’t see why you should think
so. I’m happy—absolutely happy! Can’t
you see how happy I am?” She bit her
lip to keep it from quivering. “And as
for there being an end—Oh, Miss Dallerton,
there isn’t an <span class='it'>end</span> for a woman like me,
there’s only—a new beginning!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that you will try with me?” said
Muriel with an insistence that she herself
could scarcely understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ten minutes are up,” said Mrs. Covering
trying hard to smile, “and I have an
appointment. If it is ever possible I will
come to you, Miss Dallerton—at any rate I
shall never forget that you asked me. But
I do not think I shall come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She walked quickly away, and Muriel
watched her in silence. She remembered
that people had said Sally Covering was
the best-dressed woman in London. She
was still—for it is rarely that the little
things change. We don’t forget to put on
gloves because our heart is broken. Muriel
felt a passion to be alone. Alone in this
world of green, robbed for the moment of
its fresh beauty; alone to face the problem
that rose in inexorable, dark power in
society as well as in the slums—the problem
which seems ever the same unrelenting
enemy of joy and health and the beauty
of life, and attacked the vital principles of
all she believed in and hoped for. It was
very difficult to go back to the group of
merry idlers, dancing like butterflies over
a precipice—butterflies intent on hiding
from the unwary that there <span class='it'>is</span> a precipice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The buzz of talk increased as she drew
near them. One lady put up her lorgnette
and looked at her as if she were some
new invention, and then turning said in a
perfectly audible voice: “The paragon of
virtue approaches, but I don’t see the lost
sheep!” The group dispersed and left
Muriel for a moment with her hostess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Muriel, how <span class='it'>could</span> you do such a
thing?” wailed Mary Huntly. “People
must draw a line somewhere, you know.
They may swallow the slums, but for <span class='it'>you</span>—before
their very eyes——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To speak to an old friend,” said Muriel
quietly. “Mary, you can’t blame me. It’s
terrible! terrible! But just because it is,
one can’t let it pass!” Mary shrugged her
shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s hopeless to argue with you, child,”
she said. “Yet even you must see that if
people <span class='it'>will</span> do such things, they must be
ignored for the sake of society at large.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Society at large,” said Muriel bitterly,
“which has caused the trouble, must protect
itself from its own victims, I understand,
Mary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what would you have one do?”
said Mary Huntly. “What good did your
speaking to her do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It showed her that one cared,” said
Muriel. “Too late, I am afraid, in her case.
But one must give them a chance to come
back, or at least see where they have gone,
and wake them up to the horror of it! If
you leave them to wake up too late for
themselves, they will only fall into a
deeper horror!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A woman of that sort,” said Mrs. Huntly
“is incorrigible—simply incorrigible,
Muriel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mary, you don’t mean that, I know.
If it was some one you loved you would try
to help her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Huntly turned with relief to welcome
Dr. Grant. There was a positive pleasure
in her greeting. It put an end to an unpleasant
situation. The only thing in life
that Mrs. Huntly was afraid of was an unpleasant
situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s your doctor, child,” she said in
an undertone; “do go and wander.” Muriel
accepted the proposition almost willingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geoff looked this afternoon so strong and
unconventional—not even a frock-coat
could make a man-about-town out of him.
Not that he in the least answered her problem.
He would probably have refused to
discuss it with her, and would certainly
have disagreed with her in his conclusions;
and yet there was something in the strong,
sound spirit of the man infinitely refreshing
to her after the cruel butterflies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with a new sense of trust and confidence
in him that she wandered in the
gardens. She realized at last that the
parting of the ways had come between her
old friends and her new life. Before she
had been happy with them because her
eyes were shut, now she saw beneath all
that seemed gay and delightful a horror of
selfishness, hardness and wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Covering never came to her; but
whenever she felt a longing to return to the
old life the thought of her face and the
knowledge of what the day’s wanderings
had shown her came back with the same
bitterness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew that the man with whom Mrs.
Covering had made “the dreadful break”
would soon be received back into society
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mothers with marriageable daughters
do not ask too many questions if the woman
disappears—and the woman always disappears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were times when Muriel almost
envied Mary her faith in the incorrigible—it
relieved her of so much responsibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Really</span>, Gladys,” said Mary Huntly
firmly, “I think you should give some reason
for the way you are behaving. I don’t
want to bother you, but there was my own
brother, Cyril——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the use of fast-days and a cope,
Mary? I should give him beefsteaks on
Fridays and sausages for vigils, and he
would apply for a separation. Besides, I
don’t care for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is still Alec Bruce,” said Mary
Huntly slowly. “He would let you have
your own way in everything, and never
remember a fast from one year’s end to
another. Muriel Dallerton was engaged to
him once years ago, before she met Captain
Hurstly. It was her fault entirely that it
was broken off, she was so down on
him. By the way, what has become of your
friendship for Muriel?” Gladys shrugged
her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fancy marrying a man who would let
you have your own way in everything. I
should be bored to death. No, Mary, I am
only twenty, and I really will marry somebody
sometime I promise you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ignored the question about Muriel
and got up idly to look at the paper. After
a few minutes it fell on her lap, and she
gazed with wide-open eyes straight in front
of her. In print, so that all the world could
see, ran an announcement of a severe hunting
accident to Captain Hurstly of the ——,
with the addition that Miss Dallerton, his
<span class='it'>fiancée</span>, and her uncle were soon to be on
their way out to India to join him. It was
thought probable that in the event of Captain
Hurstly’s recovery the young couple
would be married out there. Gladys
watched with fascinated gaze the skilful
movements of the footmen removing tea.
She never forgot the delicate traced pattern
on the cloth, or the two muffins and a half.
She carefully counted and wondered, with
an interest out of proportion to its subject,
what would eventually be their fate. It
did not surprise her that Edith le Mentier
should be announced, and she found herself
smiling quite naturally at that lady’s little
graceful poses, when suddenly she heard
herself addressed by name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you heard of Muriel Dallerton’s
great <span class='it'>coup</span>? My dear child, you really
should go in for slum clubs—they’re so taking.
I should do it myself if I could ever
think of anything to say to those kind of
creatures. And then one finds out that
she’s been all the time engaged to Jack
Hurstly, and is actually going out to India
to nurse him through an accident and pull
him safely into the bonds of matrimony.
If I were a yellow journalist I could make
the most touching headlines for it—‘Death
or Marriage?’ ‘If he survives the first accident,
will he survive the second?’ etc.”
Gladys laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Mrs. le Mentier,” she said, “perhaps
it’s not so inevitable as all that. Mary
was telling me she had been engaged before.”
There was a moment’s silence. Mrs.
Huntly looked sharply across at her friend,
and Edith subdued a smile. She could
not resist, however, a little shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once upon a time there was a naughty
boy,” she said, “so Muriel put him in the
corner, and he ran away. Isn’t that true,
Mary?” The door opened and two maiden
ladies, who were very charitable and rather
plain, took up Mrs. Huntly’s attention.
Gladys drew Edith to the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Captain Hurstly a good boy?” she
said, smiling. Edith looked down at her
caressingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One’s always good if one isn’t found
out,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if one is found out, one is much
worse,” persisted Gladys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think Muriel ever cared for
Alec Bruce,” said Mrs. le Mentier. “Why,
don’t you wish her to marry Jack?” she
added, glancing at the girl tenderly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so sorry for the doctor,” smiled
Gladys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Muriel knew,” Gladys continued,
“that he was not such a good boy, she
would be certain to put him in the corner
even longer, because she does care for
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she sees him now while he’s ill she’ll
give in. We all do when Nature takes it
into her head to punish,” mused Mrs. le
Mentier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then if she knew soon, she wouldn’t
go?” asked Gladys. “I’m going to see her
to-morrow,” she added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Muriel,” said Mrs. le Mentier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I take her any message from
you?” Gladys questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” said Mrs. le Mentier, “that I
must go myself to wish her <span class='it'>bon voyage</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. le Mentier went home and arranged
two little packets of letters—letters that
might have been burned, that ought to
have been burned, only that some women
have the fatal habit of holding on to the
wrong things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gladys went upstairs and cried, and hated
herself, and bathed her eyes, and hated
Muriel more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, quite unconsciously, Muriel
packed her trunk and gave last directions
to Cynthia about the club and its management
in her absence, and in her heart she
prayed, “O God, let him live—let him
live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Jack Hurstly fought with death and
heat and India through long hours of
breathless night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boat did not sail until evening, and as
Muriel parted from Cynthia Grant to go on
to her uncle’s on a cold, chilly November
morning a hansom drove to the door, and
Gladys, deeply veiled, sprang out. She
greeted Muriel with her old tender affection.
In a minute or more they were rattling away
through the dim streets together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t understand,” said Gladys at last,
“what it all means. You cannot be breaking
your word to me—you cannot. I have
trusted you so. But I have waited so long
for an explanation, and it has never come,
and now you are going to him.” Muriel
looked steadily at her companion with unfaltering,
sad eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I made a terrible mistake,” she said
gently. “For a while I thought it in my
power to give to you that which can’t be
transferred. But why should we talk of this
now?—even while we speak he may have
passed beyond it all!” Gladys wrung her
hands together desperately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is mine,” she muttered—“mine—and
I shall never see his face again!”
Then suddenly she controlled herself.
“You have broken your word?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have,” said Muriel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you expect a marriage founded on
broken promises to prosper?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! he may be dead,” said Muriel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hansom drove up to the door; the
two girls looked at each other; Gladys did
not get out, but as Muriel moved towards
the house she leaned out of the window.
“I pray to God he is dead,” she said quietly,
then she gave the address to the cabman.
She left a card at Mrs. le Mentier’s door:
“Muriel is with her uncle—they go to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>I hope</span>, my dear,” said Mrs. le Mentier,
“that I am not too frightfully out of place.
But the fog drove me to you—it positively
did. Mystery is so more-ish, and you know
how dreadfully curious I am. When were
you first engaged to Jack, dear?” Muriel
smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, truly,” she said, “for it
feels now as if it was always.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it must have been very recent.
Recent things always feel like that,” said
Edith. She sank down before the fire and
began to warm her hands; the rings on
them gleamed and glittered with an almost
malicious sparkling. “It is very brave of
you to marry Jack,” she murmured, smiling—“very
brave. I hardly think I should
have had the pluck to if I were single
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel looked in front of her. She was
counting the minutes; every one seemed a
slow, aching century separating her from
the man who might be dying. It was a
refined mode of torture to have to talk of
him. She began to understand the feeling
of a caged wild beast. As an expression it
is trite, but as an emotion it possessed her
as original.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not very consistent, are you?”
suggested Mrs. le Mentier with a little hard
laugh. “We none of us are, I suppose;
only it’s rather disappointing to us wicked
ones when one of the saints back down.
Being so deficient ourselves we expect so
much more of them. It’s the shock that
one feels when a really good cook fails in his
favorite dish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I’m not consistent, and I’m
sure I’m not one of the saints,” said Muriel
with a little strained smile. “What do you
mean, Mrs. le Mentier?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once on a time,” replied her companion
critically, regarding her dainty hands, “there
was a girl who wouldn’t marry a man—there’s
nothing so very astonishing about
that, you’ll say; it’s happened before and
it may happen again. But she wouldn’t
marry him because she found out that his
record showed a stumble or two. One may
consider her a little fastidious, but one respects
her. The man behaved very nicely;
he respected her too. But then there came
another man, and human nature made her
forget all about his record, which, when you
come to think of it, is very natural, and not
at all to be blamed. It is a pity to be too
fastidious, but one can’t perhaps respect
her as much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. le Mentier,” said Muriel, rising to
her feet, “will you kindly tell me what you
mean?” Mrs. le Mentier slowly began to
draw on her gloves—they fitted her to perfection—but
she remained seated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might ask Jack when you see him—if
he is well enough to be bothered with
such unimportant things—if he remembers
four years ago this last July. You might
ask him if he would like you to see his
correspondence at that time. You might
laugh with him, when he is convalescent,
over these letters. I have them in this
little bag here, which when I heard of your
engagement seemed better in your hands
than mine. You might,” said Edith, holding
out her hand to Muriel, and smiling
her sweetest smile, “tell Captain Hurstly
that his old friends have not forgotten him.
Good-bye, my dear Muriel; <span class='it'>bon voyage</span>—my
best respects to your uncle—don’t trouble
to come downstairs—do you know the last
good remedy for <span class='it'>mal-de-mer</span>?—you never
suffer from it? That’s right; a speedy
return, my dear, and mind you don’t forget
my little messages to Jack when you see
him—good-bye!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel waited until the door was closed,
then she went and looked at the letters.
She knew the handwriting; she hungered
for a sight of any words from him; and she
looked at it now as if she was looking at it
for the last time. Then she sat down where
Edith le Mentier had been sitting, and tore
them up one by one and threw them into
the fire. Muriel had scarcely finished when
Sir Arthur came into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Muriel!” he cried in a tone of justifiable
displeasure, “I have told you before never
to put paper into the fire. Do you know
you endanger our lives by your carelessness?
Letters should be put into the waste-paper
basket, not made bonfires of! Have you
got your trunks packed, child, and all your
arrangements made? We start in another
hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle Arthur,” said Muriel quietly, “you
will think me very strange, I know, and very
wilful, but I’m not going to start to-day.
I’m going back to the club to-night. I—I
don’t think I am feeling very well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Expression for the most part is a distinctly
limited faculty, and those who carry
it to its bounds in the ordinary occurrence
of life find nothing left to say when the
occasion transcends their experience. Sir
Arthur Dallerton was dumb; he made
several efforts to speak—he put his hand to
his heart—he stared at the ceiling—he was
almost startled into a prayer—finally he
gasped out:⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wicked girl! Send my man to
me,” and closed his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel escaped. He had not tried to
combat her decision; he was in fact very
much relieved not to have to go. He had
only submitted to the mid-winter journey
because it was expected of him—but he
was surprised, horribly surprised. There
is something very shocking to an Englishman
in any sudden change: to Sir Arthur
Dallerton it amounted to a crime. Muriel
had surprised him, and he could not forgive
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was dark when Muriel drove back to
the club that night, but the fog had lifted
and the stars were out. There was something
in the street lights and noises that
awoke in her the tremendous emptiness the
world can hold. It was a shadow, a delusion,
a mere dim, spectral mist, the background
for an infinite weary pain that made the
real pivot of the universe. She almost killed
herself with self-reproaches. What was she
that she should blot out the glory of her
lover’s world for the words of a jealous
woman?—for a mistake in the past—a sin if
you choose. It might be a sin. If he had
sinned all the sins, if he was sin itself, it
didn’t matter—she loved him—loved him—loved
him! And the great steamer with its
iron speed might even now be leaving the
docks, and she had set her face against him
like a flint, and there was no turning back.
Life had placed before her the old choice of
love and duty, and though passion justified
of reason rose with double power to storm
the fortress of her will, and last, and bitterest
of all, the traitor within called to her to
give way for hope’s sake, life’s sake, love’s
sake, when it seemed for another’s good—to
release one she would have gladly died to
comfort—to gain that which in all the
world she most desired for his sake, for her
own, for the apparent good of them both—(Oh,
how the traitor clamors at the gate, the
traitor with those eyes, that voice!)—all the
glowing world of hers, the infinite golden
gladness of love—even with those to oppose
and madden her, she shut her hands tight,
and with a wordless, inexpressible prayer
lifted up her soul. With most the struggle
comes before decision, with many at the
point itself, but with some few it is after
the decision is made and when there is no
turning back. So Muriel struggled now,
though at the moment she had been wrapt
as it were apart from all uncertainty in the
cloud of renunciation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Muriel!” Cynthia stood before her,
petrified. Had she had news it was too
late? She drew her towards the fire, and
Muriel sat down and looked at her wistfully
as a child might.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I had better tell you all about it
now,” she said, “though I feel sure you will
not understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have been doing something foolish,
I suppose,” said Cynthia curtly. “Well,
what is it?” But she drew very tenderly
the girl’s jacket off, and smoothed her hair
with gentle hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have given Jack up,” said Muriel
wearily, “because Edith le Mentier——”
she stopped. “Oh, I can’t explain,” she
murmured. “The words don’t mean anything,
but—but, Cynthia, I couldn’t marry
a man who had once loved, or thought he
loved, that woman. I could not trust a
man whom I felt was weaker than I. If I
had children——” she paused again. “You
see I knew a woman who married, and the
man was a dear fellow; but he had been
weak, and the strain was in him—and he
was weak again. When I was engaged to
Alec Bruce she said to me, ‘It’s not of so
much importance to avoid bad men—they’re
danger signals we aren’t blind to—but
for God’s sake never marry a weak
one.’ ” Muriel caught her breath with a
little dry sob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you little idiot, you little idiot,”
cried Cynthia with flashing eyes. “What’s
another woman’s, any woman’s, all other
women’s experience to one’s own heart?
Love, and take the consequences—there’s
nothing else; it’s the only thing worth
while. Why should you condemn yourself
and Jack to a death in life because of that
wretched woman?—besides, you don’t even
know if it’s true! It’s madness, Muriel—madness.
He’ll marry somebody else, and
turn out a mere do-nothing, and you’ll wear
your life out in another five years. And it’s
all useless, reasonless, cruel. And then
you’ll pray for his soul, and expect me too,
perhaps. But I shan’t! Can’t you see
you’re driving him back to her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel dragged herself to her feet. “You
forget I believe,” she said very slowly, “in
the life of the world to come.” Then covering
her face with her hands she burst into
tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cynthia Grant wrote that night to her
brother: “I don’t know whether it’s any
use, Geoff, but she’s broken the whole
business off between herself and Jack
Hurstly. She’s desperate, but determined.
It’s all for a mere nothing. I cannot understand
her; but I won’t let her work herself
to death if I can help it. She was a fool
ever to have cared for him, and more of a
fool not to have married him. It would be
difficult to know which we do more harm
with, we women, our hearts or our souls—‘Where
a soul may be discerned.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Muriel was on her knees all night
praying that he might live and she might
be forgiven.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XVI</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote20em'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“If Winter come, can Spring be far behind!”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was a day when all hope of spring was left
behind—withered in a black northeaster—when
every one unfortunate enough to be in
England longs for the south of France, and
every one who has been out of England compares
it unfavorably with other climates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cynthia had left Muriel with a frightful
cold and the club accounts, and had gone
out to buy her some violets. They had
heard that morning from Mary Huntly that
Jack was recovering, though the fever resulting
from the accident had necessitated
sick leave. He would probably have got
Muriel’s letter by now. Cynthia looked
longingly at some impossibly expensive
roses, when she heard a man’s voice behind
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove! Cynthia!” Her heart leaped
from January to June. She turned her
head slightly to face the obtruder—a delicate,
fine-looking man with the eyes of a
poet, and a chin which it would do some
poets good to have. It took a moment for
them to get over the memory of the last
time they had met. It had begun to rain a
little, and people had put up their umbrellas
and pushed on more rapidly than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want?” he asked, looking
from the girl to the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can you afford?” said Cynthia,
laughing. She was wondering what people
wanted to hurry for on such a lovely day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very rich,” he responded. “Honor
bright! I could buy over the business. I
sold my last picture for—I can’t tell you
how much, it might stir up your demon of
independence. I’m going to get you the
roses.” In two minutes he came back
with them in his hand. “By the way,
you might as well put up your umbrella,
mightn’t you, it seems to be raining?” he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, so it is,” said Cynthia absently.
They stood together uncomfortably, knowing
that if no good excuse arose they would
have to part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think a cup of tea would be
nice?” he suggested. Cynthia nodded her
head decisively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said, “and muffins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you remember,” said her companion,
as they turned towards a possible restaurant
“those dear little French cakes and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t remember anything,” said Cynthia
sternly, “and I’m not going to.”
Leslie Damores laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You even forgot,” he said teasingly,
“just now that it was raining!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you were in France. I didn’t
know you were ever coming back to England
again,” said Cynthia a little doubtfully.
She noticed that he had not asked her what
she was doing, and it hurt her. She would
volunteer no information. They sat down
by a clean table in a warm inner room;
neat-capped maids fluttered here and there;
it was very restful and very English. To the
artist who had not been in England for
eight years it was home, and the girl who
held the roses in her lap filled in the picture.
He studied her face carefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re awfully changed,” he said at
last. Cynthia laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was twenty-two when I saw you last,
and now I am thirty. I was never one of
the dimpling kind that stay young either;
as for you—you’re a man, so it’s different.
But”—her voice grew strangely gentle—“you’re
not quite the same, you know,
Leslie; fame has come to you, and you look
more of a fighter, and yet not quite so
hard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strange, isn’t it, that youth should be
so exacting—with its impossible whites and
blacks—and that the more one roughs it,
and the harder knocks one gets, the more
generously shaded it all becomes,” he said,
watching her with keen, eager eyes. She
turned her head away and played restlessly
with the flowers in her lap. “It could
never change as much as that,” she thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The muffins were the nicest she had ever
tasted, the white-capped maid the prettiest,
the tea the most refreshing. It all passed
so terribly soon, and through it all they
laughed and chaffed each other like two
schoolboys in the slang of the Paris studio.
It appeared that Cynthia had not forgotten
quite so sweepingly as she asserted; they
were too afraid of being in earnest to do
anything but talk nonsense. They left the
little place reluctantly, Leslie Damores
feeing the white-capped maid beyond the
dreams of avarice. She decided that he
must be American. The rain had stopped,
and wintry sunset gleams warned Cynthia
of the hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m late,” she said; “you’d better call
a hansom.” He hesitated before he asked
where he should tell the cabman to drive.
Cynthia set her lips. “He might have
spared me that,” she thought. He was a
delicate fellow, and he shivered slightly in
the cold. It was this that settled her. “I
am working with a friend of mine in the
slums,” she said hastily. “Here is my card
with the address on it; look us up some day
if you can spare the time—good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went off whistling like a boy with his
hands in his pockets, wondering when
might be the earliest he might go to her,
and upbraiding himself for his wish earlier
in the afternoon never to have set foot in
London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cynthia came into the little dark lodging-room
like a fire, a whirlwind, and summer
lightning all in one. There were the flowers
to arrange, lamps to be lit, the supper to
get. Muriel watched her with surprise.
This magnificent woman, with wide-open,
happy eyes, strange, sudden smiles, that
came and went, and air of life and sunshine,
was a transformation from the cold, stern
woman with the grim and almost repellant
attitude of hard reserve. She was sweetened,
softened, glorified, and she looked at
Muriel as a mother might look at her child.
The evening was full of club-work, and even
there Cynthia showed herself brightly. As
a rule she “had no patience with the girls,”
and ruled more by fear than love, mingled
with a sort of good-natured contempt. But
to-night there was a new look of friendliness
in her eyes, and her voice grew kind and
gentle as she explained some simple medical
rules of health, giving the girls object-lessons
in bandaging, showing them how to check
hæmorrhage, so absorbed and interested
herself that in spite of themselves the girls
drew near and listened. One of them, a
tall, slender girl of some fifteen years, with
already the face of a woman of thirty,
pushed her way to the front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oy siy, can you do hanythink for a little
fellar with a bad back?” Cynthia nodded
shortly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t interrupt the class; you can bring
him to me afterwards,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl with a coarse laugh pushed
through her companions to the door. It was
a strange scene: the large room of the old
factory, clean and bright, with a blazing
fire; a work-table on which lay piles of
bandages and splints; groups of rough,
strangely garbed, out-of-elbows women,
each with a large curled fringe, under which
the tired eyes appealed to one as strangely
unnatural, and, in the midst of them, trim,
erect, commanding Cynthia. Orders, questions,
explanations ringing out. She stood
like a disciplined sergeant amongst a throng
of raw recruits—and recruits they were, let
into the great army of humanity with no
safeguards, no training, or only the most
elementary, all dreary, purposeless, hacking
their way through life. Only now and then
into this rank-and-file of the world dipped
their more splendid sisters who knew the
aim of it all, and could teach them the
means of attainment. There, under the
flaring gas-jets, in the midst of the strange,
teeming life of Stepney, horrible, oppressive,
marvellously primitive, naked of the veneer
of civilization, two women labored to bring
light and help. Cynthia felt strangely uplifted.
Her heart was singing the song
“The stars sing in their spheres.” She did
not feel the hopelessness of it all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the class was over she was about
to lock up the club and go back to Muriel,
when the girl who had interrupted the
class entered again carrying a bundle in her
arms. She placed it very gently on the
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Ere’s the little fellar,” she said quietly.
Cynthia pulled back the blanket and started
with surprise at the picture before her—a
baby boy of three years old, his head a mass
of black curls, and underneath great blue
Irish eyes. His face, flushed with recent
sleep, looked up at her. The girl seeing
the admiration in her face smiled proudly.
“ ’E’s all I ’ave,” she said. “Mother left ’im
to me to see to three years since, for father
’e went off with another woman, and she
took it to ’art, mother did, so she died.
Think likely ’e’ll git better, miss?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cynthia lifted the child into her arms.
There was no mistaking the cruelly twisted
spine. He might live two years, or even
three, but it was a bad case—incurable. She
looked from the beautiful baby face to the
eager, passionate look in the girl’s eyes, who
was hungry for an answer. Cynthia felt
angry with the hopeless tragedy of it. Possibly
Muriel might have known what to
say; for herself she raved against the invincible
spirit of maternity, at once the
torture and compensation for all who love
the little ones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does he suffer much?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’E do cry hawful sometimes, pore little
chap. Can you do hanythink, miss?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do anything? I daresay I can make
him a little easier, but it’s a very bad case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean as ’ow ’e’ll never get any
better?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid not, Carrie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean as ’ow ’e’ll die?” There
was an awful intensity in the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He may live some time yet.” The girl
wrapped the child up in the blanket; the
fierceness in her eyes did not prevent the
gentle touches of her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ’ate God, so there! an’ I ’ate the club!
an’ I ’ate you and the other lidy! I ’ate you
all!” she cried hoarsely. Then suddenly
the anger died out of her face; she turned
hopelessly to the door, pausing irresolutely
she asked again in dull despair, “Then there
isn’t hanythink as you can do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very little, I’m afraid.” She drew the
blanket closer round the child and passed
out into the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was late and Muriel had gone to bed.
Cynthia came in and sat down by her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think a man would ever trust a
girl a second time?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would depend, wouldn’t it,” said
Muriel thoughtfully, “upon the girl’s character,
and the attitude towards the broken
trust, and how long ago it had happened,
and what she had done in the meantime?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think it possible if she was
different that he would love her again?”
Muriel sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would have married Jack,” she said,
“if he had been different, but he was the
same. I suppose it all depends on whether
one’s power of detachment is strong
enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re very tired, dearest,” said Cynthia,
“and I shouldn’t bother you; but—but
I suppose you pray, don’t you?”
Muriel smiled; she did not say she had done
nothing else since she had forfeited her
life’s happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I try to,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” said Cynthia, “perhaps you
might as well pray for me. Good-night!”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XVII</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote20em'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“Our mind receives but what it holds—no more.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>People</span> whom everybody considers tender-hearted
and good-natured do not like to
wake up to the fact that they are neither.
It takes a good deal to wake them up to it,
and they are apt to be indignant and incredulous
even then. Gladys had always
been considered particularly, gracefully unselfish.
People might think her a little
astonishing and unconventional, but this
they put down to her American training;
as for being underhand, cruel and grasping,
no one would have dreamed it of her, and
she least of all of herself. Love is a teacher
of many lessons, and tears away all screens;
there is no room left for anything but the
real.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Love and pain together are the two world
forces for sincerity, and Gladys’ sincerity
was not pleasant to look at. She was possessed
with the one desire—Jack. She
wanted him; she hated everything and
everybody else. Right and wrong became
two faint, inadequate words; she would
have stopped at nothing to gain her ends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even the dramatic instinct which had
carried her through emotional friendships
made her attractive and alluring to those
to whom she was utterly indifferent, devout
and regular in her religious attendances,
eager and sympathetic over the miseries of
the poor, they were all swept away. She
planned, plotted, schemed and lived to
meet and win Jack Hurstly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the sake of meeting him she made
friends to a far greater extent with Edith le
Mentier. She smiled in tender graciousness
upon Alec Bruce, she treated Sir Arthur
Dallerton when she met him with the
greatest interest and respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was through him she learned first that
Muriel was not going to India, second that
her engagement with Jack Hurstly was
“off,” after that she ceased to take any
interest in him at all. People said it was
time she was married.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It took Jack a long time to realize that
Muriel meant what she said. He wrote
again, and it was not till she stopped answering
him that he began to believe her.
The key he held to the woman riddle says
that “A woman who goes on saying no is
easier to turn than the woman who says
nothing.” India and the old influences of
the regiment had undone a good deal of
her training.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack told himself he was a fool to have
loved her, and agreed with the world’s
verdict that she “really went too far.” In
fact the world turned its back on her. She
had had two good marriages in her hand
and thrown them away; her society was a
strain; she did unheard-of things; she was
really better in the slums.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everybody told him he was well out of
it, and though he was outwardly indignant
at their judgment it took the edge off his
sorrow. He grew rapidly strong, and
hunted more than ever. He was not to be
invalided home, and he had been very badly
treated. He looked upon this as virtual
absolution for whatever dissipations he
might be led into. Even in the nineteenth
century few men have found a better
excuse than “The woman Thou gavest
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening as Jack sat smoking in his
quarters, wondering lazily what sort of a
drink it would be most possible to enjoy,
a knock at the door aroused him from his
thoughts, and gave entrance to a favorite
young subaltern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, Musgrave!—come in!” he said
with warmth. “Have a drink?” he added
as the young fellow sank into a chair.
Musgrave shook his head. “Anything
up?” Jack asked with surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing particular,” said Jim Musgrave.
“My aunt’s coming out here,
though. I shall have to sit up for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I say that’s bad,” said his friend
sympathetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s going to bring a mighty pretty girl
out with her, though, to jam the powder,”
said the nephew irreverently. “The fact of
the matter is I believe it’s for the girl’s sake
she’s coming. There’s an awful dearth
going on in London—herds of pretty girls
and nothing to gain by it, you know—I
don’t know what England’s coming to—we’re
so scarce—they say the returns after
the season are something awful!” Jack
laughed grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m one of them,” he said. “I didn’t
make myself scarce enough it seems. Who’s
your aunt, by-the-bye? Perhaps I know
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Huntly. Her husband was a
fellow of ‘ours,’ you know; but he got on
the shelf, and they gave him some appointment
at home to hush him asleep with.
We have an awfully short day, haven’t we?
And a beastly hot one!” The young man’s
eyes grew wistful, for he loved his profession;
and he had not been out long enough
to grow stale, or to have his ambitions adjust
themselves to lower standards. Jack
sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a bit too long for some of us,” he
said; and he dutifully thought of Muriel,
till the remembrance of a polo match transformed
them both into enthusiasts, and the
talk grew unintelligibly technical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not until Jim Musgrave rose to go
back to his own quarters that Jack remembered
to tell him that his aunt was an old
friend of his, and to ask if the pretty girl
was her cousin, Miss Travers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove, do you know her?” shouted
the surprised Jim. Jack nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night!” he said briefly, and Jim
took his dismissal, wondering how well his
friend had known Miss Travers. Jack
remembered the look in Gladys’ eyes, and
resolutely pretended that it meant nothing;
nevertheless he was not altogether sorry
he was going to see her again. He told
himself it was because she was Muriel’s
great friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he went out to have a final look at
the pony; it was necessary that it should
be really fit for to-morrow’s match.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Muriel</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You and I have always been
good friends, and though I have never said
anything to you about your trouble over
Jack Hurstly it has not been because I have
not felt for you. I thought that you were
very foolish to give him up. Still you were
never really suited to each other, and it is
better to give a thing up than to hold on
to it too long. I think one of the saddest
things is to realize how well one can get on
without some one who seemed so absolutely
necessary. Men always reach it soonest,
for if they can’t attain their ideals they can
satisfy their instincts, while we women have
to rub on between the two and dress nicely.
My husband wants to see India again—why,
I don’t know—smells, heat, travel and inferior
races, not to mention being cut off from
everything for months, and I’ve promised
to accompany him, principally because it’s
easier to accept than refuse, and Gladys
seems so set on it. She has promised to
give Alec Bruce his answer when she returns.
It is positively a last flourish, she declares;
and between you and me I think she means
to try once more for the bird in the bush
before settling on the hand one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s rather brutal of me to write of it to
you, but though she is clever enough and
blinds most people I feel certain she cares
for Jack, and I am a little uncertain as to
how he will act when he finds it out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If pebbles were as rare, we should most
of us prefer them to diamonds, I expect,
and only a few would say, ‘Ah, but they
don’t shine!’ How you will shake your
head, dear! but, trust me, proximity and
the hat that suits weigh a good deal more
than a fine character with most men, and
Gladys always chooses her hats well.
Women of my age are past the time of
romance (Edith le Mentier would scarcely
agree with me). Legitimate romance, at
any rate—if there is such a thing—is a little
worn out, and I’m not one of the sort that
prefer religion to rouge, yet to-night I can’t
help confessing the game seems not worth
the candle. Not much behind, and not
much before, and very little for the meantime.
Still I should marry if I were you.
You’ll have the compensation of saying
‘Well, that’s done,’ and when everything
else seems unsubstantial the solid inevitability
of wife and motherhood keeps one
steady. That’s my argument against free
love—it’s not final enough, and the uncertainties
are too great. I had rather myself
have a broken heart and a settled position
than a broken heart without one. Perhaps
you will succeed in avoiding both. Don’t
think I’m morbid—probably my dinner has
disagreed with me. By-the-bye, the doctor
says there’s something wrong with my
lungs—but I don’t believe in doctors.
Good-bye.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“<span class='sc'>Mary.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel read Mary Huntly’s letter over
slowly with sad eyes. There was a hopeless
ring in it, as if the plucky effort to avoid the
admission of a life failure had almost proved
too much for her. She had attained most
things that a woman of the world wishes to
attain: a good income, a convenient husband,
a boy at Eton, and a fine figure for
forty; she was very popular, even with
other women, and she had a most capital
cook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leslie Damores and I are going on a
bus top to Kew Gardens this afternoon,”
said Cynthia irrelevantly. “And I shall go
to tea with him in the studios to see his new
picture; he has called it ‘The Years of the
Locust.’ I should rather like to see what
he has made of it.” Muriel was still puzzling
over Mary Huntly’s letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is so fine,” she said. “It must count
for something, her pluck and dash and the
way she faces things; it can’t be all shallow,
or all selfish—and yet it does work death.
Look at poor Mary. Her age of primary
things has passed. She has run through
most of the thrills, as I suppose we all do
by forty, and now what’s left for her? She
has been keeping yesterday’s manna, and
she finds that it has gone bad!” Cynthia
looked interested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” she said slowly, “that a great
love is the only thing to fill a woman’s life.
I don’t believe that would wear out, would
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose,” said Muriel thoughtfully,
“that depends on how one uses it; one
must carry things on to their farthest extent.
I mean—it’s stifling to be satisfied. If we
go on far enough we shall come to a vista,
and it’s not till we get to see that things
have no end that we are really beginning at
all. It is what you can’t grasp makes life
worth living.” Cynthia listened reluctantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But love,” she said again, “you can
grasp that; and it won’t go, will it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All that’s best and highest in love you
can’t grasp, I think,” replied Muriel. “It’s
because one expects to do that that it hurts.
The invincible thrill of things is only meant
as a launching into life. After that friendship,
comradeship, a blending of life to life
and heart to heart becomes unconscious
development. Paroxysms aren’t love, and
they have their reaction; but love is beyond
and through all, and even in the most sad
and sordid moments gleams and throbs an
impossible possibility! A thing always to
strive for, never to attain!” Cynthia rose
and paced the room restlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Muriel! Muriel!” she said, “you
don’t know——” Then she stopped short,
and went over and kissed her, an unusual
demonstration from Cynthia. “You’re so
good,” she said, “and yet somehow so remote
from it all! I think I begin to see
now why you didn’t marry Jack. I should
have faced it as you did, but I should have
read the letters, talked about them—and
then married him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And been unhappy ever afterwards,”
said Muriel softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! but that’s nothing to do with it,”
cried Cynthia impatiently. “I acknowledge
no afterwards. I would give myself body
and soul to the man I loved, like Browning’s
lady, even if he were the greatest rascal
unhung!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a horribly selfish theory!” said
Muriel with sudden emphasis, “and a very
dangerous one. You would degrade yourself,
hurt the man, and ruin future generations,
simply because of an effervescing
passion, which soon becomes stagnant if you
give it time enough. No one can afford to
ignore consequences, least of all a lover.
Why is it, do you suppose, that these girls
of mine, living like animals, working like
slaves, suffering like human beings, don’t
oftener catch at this passion-flower of yours,
and take the poison of it? Simply because
they are face to face with the consequences.
They can’t get away from themselves, and
their life is visible and public. They know
what a few days’ rapture implies—shame,
pain, publicity, perhaps starvation. They
know that to cut off your nose spites your
face, however you may wish to make the
surrender! You don’t risk a rapid when
you see the rocks, only when the rocks are
hidden; the consequences ignored, then the
selfish, hopeless, aimless life gives in to its
instincts; and though before the leap you
may have ignored the consequences, it will
not prevent the rocks beneath from grinding
your life out after the fall.” She stopped,
her eyes flashing with the intensity of all
she meant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had given little by little her life over
to a problem; one that she hated, had
avoided, and that even now racked her
with its misery—but it absorbed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Things cease to be bearable only when
life is empty, and to Muriel her own sorrow,
her own heart, had been filled and uplifted
by full renunciative hours. Discontent and
leisure walk hand in hand, wandering disconsolate
over a world teeming with openings
and opportunities for energy and power.
Then it becomes necessary to invent new
games, and religion runs to melancholia—or
Christian science.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think Leslie Damores will ever
marry me,” said Cynthia slowly. She
looked suddenly older and more careworn.
“I—I don’t think I will go with him this
afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel put on her things to go to the club.
Before she went she threw her arms around
Cynthia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dearest,” she said with glistening eyes,
“I don’t know what I should do without
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray more,” said Cynthia shortly. Muriel
shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you knew what strength you give,
and how bright this all seems to come back
to!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t! don’t!” said Cynthia sharply.
“For God’s sake go to the club and leave
me alone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel went and understood; she knew
that it had been necessary to say those
words, and after they were said she could
do no more. One can start a crisis, but one
cannot guide it, and it is usually best to
get out of the way. Cynthia sent Leslie
Damores away that afternoon, and faced
for the first time in her life the years that
the locust had eaten. Her lover’s picture
could not have been more realistic.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Leslie</span> went back to the studio bewildered.
She had sent him away without excuses.
He wondered blankly what he was being
punished for, and why she was denied him
in the present; and as Kew Gardens, unless
one is a naturalist, is not the place one goes
to alone, he sat down before his picture and
thought about her in the past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was young and full of ideals when he
first met her. He believed in the possibility
of a Galahad, and that all women were
exquisitely good, except a sad few who were
picturesquely unfortunate. He had had a
good mother, two beautiful sisters, and he
had only seen Paris in a veil. He met
Cynthia in the studios; her glorious red hair
and the wonderful way she looked at him
became the key to the universe. After that
followed months of ideal companionship,
and on his part at least unprecedented
blindness. Perhaps she loved him for that
most of all. Then she told him. He was
horribly startled. He said surprised and
terrible things, and then she looked at him—Oh
that wonderful, broken, tragic look!—and
went back to her brother. And he
grew older, and wiser, and less surprised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had not meant to find her in London.
When he had, and they met again and yet
again, and in fact even from the moment
when she had told him where and how she
lived, he had made the great decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The locusts should eat no more empty
years. If she could forget (<span class='it'>could</span> she forget,
forgive at least?) that stammering judgment
eight years ago, how happy they would
be together! What noble, magnificent work
would they not do—together—and now she
had sent him away with no excuse. Had
that self-made barrier of his fallen for
another to rise? He smoked hard and rang
the bell. There is always one way of finding
out things if a man has sense and no false
pride—to ask. He was going to ask, and
he smiled grimly to himself as he thought of
the answer she would give him—<span class='it'>should</span> give
him!—if strength and power and purpose
went for anything. The tea-things that
were set out for her looked miserable as
only neglected food can look, and the room
lost in the gathering twilight seemed emptily
expectant of the guest who had not
come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leslie Damores cared nothing at all for
omens and less for gloom, and even the fact
that he could not find his matches did not
evoke a frown. He was going to see her, and
he <span class='it'>meant</span> to see her, and he terribly over-paid
the cabman’s fare. How many sullen
looks and surly words do we not owe to the
over-generosity of lovers, who appear to
think that by tipping the universe they will
earn the reward of Providence in the shape
they most desire? Alas! we human beings
are always misplacing our tips, and then we
wonder when the raps that come to us seem
to be misplaced as well!</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XX</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“God is in all men, but all men are not in God: that is
the reason why they suffer.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was hot, with that intense silken quiver
in the air which turns the atmosphere into
a living creature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That “certain twilight” moment was
already beginning to “cut the glory from
the gray,” and across the Indian garden
strolled two figures scarcely conscious of
the breathless life, so interested were they
in each other. Gladys Travers, in a well-fitting
gown, a cloud of something soft that
sunk into a shower of lovely curves, led the
way through the trees to a seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I call it a summer-house,” she said. “It
sounds so English!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” Jack Hurstly answered half wistfully,
“you’ve already begun to hunger for
home. We all have it, you know, and try to
call the most un-English things by familiar
names, just to trick ourselves into thinking—Heaven
knows what—that it isn’t quite
so far away, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems hardly possible that we have
been here two months,” sighed Gladys.
“And it <span class='it'>was</span> so strange to find you
here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strange, indeed, Gladys! after the care-succeeding
stratagem and innocent purposeful
planning that took you and your
good-natured cousin so straight across
India to the station (not so frequently a
resort for English travellers), simply because
there this broad-shouldered young
Englishman lived and rode and shot and
spoke bitterly of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was most lucky for me,” he answered
honestly; “and I shall miss you awfully
when you go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very fond of Mary, aren’t
you?” she said looking at the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Miss Travers.” Gladys smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re rather stupid, you know,” she
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it’s you who are rather unkind,”
he answered. “And what are you going
to do with Jim?” Gladys frowned; the
conversation at that moment was more interesting
without Jim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Do</span> with him!” she began indignantly,
and then suddenly she laughed and turned
dancing eyes upon her companion. “Do
you know,” she cried, “I haven’t the faintest
<span class='it'>idea</span> what to do with him! What should
you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a very nice fellow, Miss Gladys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then shall I marry him?” Captain
Hurstly drew a long breath; it was rather
like playing with fire. The sun sunk
speedily in the west, and now in a glowing
rose veil plunged behind the hills. Gladys
looked up at him from under her long eyelashes.
There was something a little wistful
in her glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you <span class='it'>want</span> me to marry him, please?”
she asked. Jack looked from the sky to
her face; it had caught the glow of the
sunset.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want you to marry anybody,”
he said simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” said Gladys, and there was a
silence—dangerous, electric, full of unspoken
things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You knew Muriel?” he said abruptly
at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was a dear friend of mine,” Gladys
replied softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Was!</span> Isn’t she now, then?” he questioned.
She blushed and looked away.
“Won’t you tell me?” he asked gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought she was unjust—very unjust
to you!” Gladys murmured. “It
hurt me that she should misunderstand
any one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re very generous,” he replied
gravely. “But how do you know, Miss
Gladys, that she did misjudge me? Perhaps
she was right to have nothing to do with
such a poor sort of chap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gladys sprang to her feet, her eyes
flashed, and she shook a little, her voice
was low and intense, and Jack, who rose
to his feet also and stood opposite to
her, was drawn into the circle of her
emotions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! Captain Hurstly. She was wrong—utterly
wrong!” the girl cried. “What are
we sheltered, protected darlings, brought
up with closed eyes and within walls, to
know of the world and man’s temptations?
How dare we judge who have no standards
of comparison? And if we love”—her
voice grew so tender it was like music—“and
if we love it is for man’s redemption, not for
the satisfaction of our own, thin, misty
ideals! And it should be the crown of our
life to raise the man we love from lower
things, and trust in his love to leave them
for ever far behind!” She moved nervously
back to the seat, and turned that she might
still half face him. “I don’t know what
I’ve been saying,” she said breathlessly. “I
am afraid it must sound very silly and foolish
to you, and rather—rather uncalled for;
but it has always seemed to me that women
like Muriel, who think God’s tools not good
enough for them, do a terrible amount of
harm.” Jack took a step forward and
looked down at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there were more women like you,” he
said huskily, “there would be fewer men—like
me, Miss Gladys.” Gladys smiled a
little. It was difficult for her to be serious
for long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” she said, “it’s certainly a good
thing that I’m unique.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear child! you know perfectly well
that this is the most unhealthy time to
be out in. Go in at once and dress for
dinner! Really, Jack, I should have
thought you would have known better!”—Mary
Huntly shook her head at him
reproachfully. Gladys lifting her eyes up
to Jack, with a mixture of amusement and
regret, turned gracefully and passed into
the house. Mary Huntly, for all her sage
advice, stayed out in the fast deepening
darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked for a little in silence towards
the gate. Mary turned over in her mind
what she should say to him. It was hard—extremely
hard—and, worse, it looked disagreeable.
She was used to doing difficult
things, but as a rule they had delightful
effects. She very much doubted as a
woman of the world whether what she had
to say would have any effect, but as a
woman a little beyond the world she knew
she ought to say it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear boy!” she said as they reached
the gate, “that girl doesn’t ring true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean, Mrs. Huntly?”
Jack asked sternly. “Are you talking of—Miss
Gladys?” He made that fatal half
instant’s pause before her name that marks
a lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have made one mistake already in
falling in love with a woman too good for
you,” she answered quietly, “don’t make
the worse one of falling in love with a
woman—not good enough! Good-night!
I think you had better not come in after
dinner this evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack would have stayed and insisted on
further explanations, for he was perplexed
and angry—there’s nothing that makes a
straightforward man so angry as perplexity—but
Jim Musgrave who was going to dine
with them came up, and in a mixture of
greetings and farewells he had to go, but
as he went he said very distinctly:⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Huntly, may I come in to-morrow?”
Mrs. Huntly saw in a flash it had
been no use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes!” she said. “What a lot of
moths you have in this climate of yours.
Good-night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gorgeous moon, the thin low whisper
of the tropic night, the rustling, murmuring
life, which rose from the earth to the low
sky above, seemed something of a new birth
to Jack as free from the fetters of an old
love he paused on the brink of a new, and
because it was new imagined there would be
no fetters.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXI</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote20em'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“She crossed his path with her hunting noose, and
over him drew her net.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gladys</span> was the incarnation of sprightliness;
her shimmering green dress made her
look like some beautiful heartless naiad of
the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When dinner was over she sang softly to
Jim, letting her eyes rest on him with a light
caressing smile. Her own world had turned
to paradise. She was playing with sunbeams
on a golden earth. It was impossible for
her to be anything but charming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary was very tired. She sat and talked
with her husband about the boy at Eton;
for a while at least she washed her hands of
Gladys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally the music stopped. Gladys’
hands sunk into her lap, and Jim looking
at her in an adoring simplicity set about
for words which were not too common to
present to his goddess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say” (the invocation seemed a little
modern) “that’s an awfully ripping dress
you’ve got on to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do <span class='it'>you</span> like it, Jim?” It was impossible
for her to help the emphasis. It had been
said of her that if she were left alone in a
desert she would flirt with a camel. Jim
would have sold his soul for a compliment,
but could only repeat:⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Awfully!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you fond of being a soldier, Jim?”
she asked. She was wondering why Jack
Hurstly did not come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it’s the grandest profession in
the world!” he said proudly. “People
don’t do us a bit of justice except when
there’s a row on, and then they praise us
for the wrong things. They don’t understand
that a man must be a decent sort of
chap to win the respect of his men; and
there are fine chances, you know, that a
fellow gets on the frontier to show what
he is made of. To hush up a disturbance
or keep a district quiet, are pretty good
pieces of work. I hope you don’t think
we’re all of us brutes or blackguards,
Miss Gladys?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Jim—oh, no!” said Gladys softly.
“I think you’re the finest men in the world,
the most chivalrous to women, the strongest
and the gentlest—truest friend and noblest
foe!” Jim thought it was too beautiful for
words, also that it was original; but it was
not exactly what he meant, and it put an
end to the discussion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How does Captain Hurstly get on with
his men?” she asked. It was evident by
her tone that she was not much interested
in Captain Hurstly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well enough,” said Jim doubtfully.
“Only you see he had rather a bad time
with a girl at home, and that rather put him
off his work, I think. He doesn’t seem as
interested as he used to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe he cared for her,” said
Gladys shortly. If there is nothing else to
do with a clumsy fact, one can ignore it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, he did awfully,” said the unconscious
Jim. “I never saw a fellow so
cut up before about a girl. She must have
been a jolly decent-looking girl, too—I’ve
seen her photograph.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really you’re very rude—you contradicted
me flatly,” cried Gladys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but he <span class='it'>did</span>, you know,” said the
over-truthful James. “<span class='it'>I</span> didn’t think she
was so awfully fetching, though,” he added
hastily, with the bright hope that jealousy
of <span class='it'>him</span> might have promoted the frown he
saw. Gladys yawned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re very dull to-night,” she said,
“doing nothing but talk of the uninteresting
love affairs of your uninteresting
friends!” Jim flushed angrily; he was conscious
that he had not introduced the subject,
but he was too loyal to say so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m very sorry, Miss Gladys,” he said;
“there’s something I’d much rather talk
about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that?” said Gladys, lifting unconscious
eyelashes with innocent ease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you know,” he said with the
dignified gravity of extreme youth over a
compliment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you mean me,” said Gladys smiling
sweetly, “I think you’re very rude to call
me a ‘thing,’ and it’s horrid bad form to
talk about a girl, you know.” The rest of
the evening passed in a pleasant, dangerous
fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At parting Jim wore the rose she herself
had worn at dinner. It was the pledge of
all dear, impossible things to him; it was
the usual termination of an evening’s episode
to her—a gardener would have accused
it of blight.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Desperation</span>, when it does not rave, becomes
a calm; and it was with an almost
listless quiet that Cynthia, sitting opposite
her brother in his office, told him she was
going away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded briefly, and went on writing
prescriptions. He had not quite finished his
evening’s work. The boy was to deliver
them to his patients. The room was bare
and light, with the usual rows of medical
books, long suggestive chair, and the sturdy
boy standing near a forbidding cupboard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cynthia’s eyes took in the surroundings
as if they had been new to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had argued bitterly with her brother
over having no lamp-shades, and the naked
bright skeleton roused in her now a sense of
irritation. Would Geoff never be done, and
why was he so little interested in her going
away?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he had always been a man of one idea,
she thought, and what interest he had was
buried in his prescriptions. Ten minutes
later he sent off the boy with a curt order or
two, then he turned and looked at his sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going away, are you?” he said. He
might have been drawing out a shy child,
or encouraging a nervous patient. Cynthia
shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I told you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you thought why, or where, or
when?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to a place in Somerset on the
red Bristol Channel, where they have mud,
and sunsets, and one can be alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The desire for mud is very modern, and
sunsets only happen once a day,” he replied
thoughtfully. “And as for being alone, you
couldn’t be in a better place than London,
you know, for that. People can’t stand
so much in the country. However, I daresay
a rest would do you good. Mind you
take some books—light ones; and be careful
where you go for milk—it’s disgraceful
how they adulterate it in out-of-way
places.” He was giving her time, and observing
with keen watching eyes the lines
of trouble and pain marked in Cynthia’s
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Geoff!” she cried with a sudden wail
in her voice, “I want you! I want you!”
He knew that she did not mean him; but
he took her in his arms and stroked her hair.
Cynthia sobbed a little in a hard choked
way; she could not let herself go completely
even in a breakdown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we go to Paris?” he asked gently.
“I have always wanted to study under the
professors there.” He looked around his
meagre office-room peopled with his love,
his work, his dreams, to stay there another
year till success lay in his grasp, to win life
for his cases, each one meaning to him what
a battle means to a soldier; all that went
to make interest, satisfaction, attainment,
must go because a woman wanted—another
man. He did not mince matters, he only
repeated the magnificent lie that rang better
than most truths, “I have always hoped for
a chance like this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you couldn’t leave your practice?”
she protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could get an assistant for a time to
take my place. It’s only for six months or
a year, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s Muriel—Geoff!” she reminded
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You told me to get the idea of her out
of my head—perhaps six months or a year
will do it,” said Dr. Grant. He was smiling
grimly to himself as he spoke. When a
man attempts endurance it makes for something
very fine. When Cynthia looked at
him she saw nothing but kind, half-amused
and wholly sympathetic eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it’s splendid you’re so placid,”
she said; “I don’t believe you feel things
at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel very much being kept away from
my supper after working hard all day!”
he laughed mischievously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you poor, dear thing! I’ll see about
it at once!” she cried running from the
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor flung open the window wide
and stood watching the streaming crowd in
the dusk. The lights seemed alive against
the dark masses of houses—impenetrable,
mysterious, holding life-histories—and
showing nothing but blank strong faces to
the passers-by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor believed in no God at all; but
when he looked above the house-tops to
the sky, peopled by myriad stars, he felt a
moment’s emotion, a thrill of hope, courage
and strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>God believed in him perhaps, and because
he would not draw near with faith led him
by his most unreasonable passion—love of
humanity—nearer than he knew to the
divine in humanity.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXIII</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote20em'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“I am half-sick of shadows.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Muriel</span> read Cynthia’s letter wonderingly.
It was short, and merely contained her
reasons for leaving Muriel for six months
at least. By the end of that time Leslie
Damores would have given her up, and she
would be more fit to take up her life again.
Muriel was not to tell him that she was
ever coming back; she was not to overdo
herself or live alone, and above all she must
not give him her address. Geoff was going
with her. Muriel sighed and frowned; the
sigh was one of loneliness. She had got so
used to companionship—Cynthia’s, and generally
her brother in the evening. It was
something to have a man to discuss things
with sensibly even if she never agreed with
him. She frowned because it was a little
strange he had not written to say good-bye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had got over caring for her that was
evident. She was glad of that—of course
she was extremely glad of it. Suddenly she
felt tired and discouraged. The girls had
been unresponsive and tiresome in the
Bible-class. She loved Paris; she could see
its clean, broad streets filled with brilliant,
rapid life, bright and gay and fresh, alive
with incessant laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a damp, foggy evening and the fire
smoked. They had such theaters in Paris,
and then the studios! Muriel had studied
there for six months in the pleasantest and
easiest fashion. Sometimes the love of her
old, careless radiant life, pleasure and
beauty, and the ease of things made her
catch her breath and remember she was
twenty-seven, and her eyes were beautiful,
and there was that couple downstairs
drunk and quarrelling again! It was too
late for tea, too early for supper, and if
she lit the candle she would have to write
letters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door-bell clanged, and she heard a
man’s voice. For a moment she thought it
was Dr. Grant coming to say good-bye.
Her hands wandered instinctively to her
hair. No!—he asked for Cynthia. He
must see her—but she was out. “Then
Miss Dallerton”—the girl “would see.”
The blackbeetle’s heavy footsteps paused
outside her door. Muriel lit the candles
and poked the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I will see Mr. Damores,” she said
smiling encouragingly at the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt less depressed because she had already
begun to sympathize, and yet she
could not help feeling angry with Leslie
Damores.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood before her, tall, handsome,
eager; she sat down and waited for him to
speak. One of the most extraordinary
things about her was her willingness to wait
for somebody else, even her silence was an
invitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cynthia wouldn’t see me,” he began,
almost boyishly. “Won’t you tell me why,
and where she is, Miss Muriel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has gone away, Mr. Damores, and
left us both. It’s a case of double desertion,
isn’t it?” she laughed nervously, for the
look in his eyes was too strongly anxious to
make the interview a pleasant one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has she left you a message for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She does not wish to see you again,”
said Muriel gravely. He was quite silent,
with his eyes bent on the carpet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then—and you—do you approve of her
decision?” he asked slowly, his voice so
different from his first eager greeting. It
was tired and a little thick. An idea
flashed through Muriel’s mind; she leaned
forward suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Damores, do you care for her?”
she asked. He squared his shoulders, and
looked back at her steadily, but a little
surprised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, Miss Muriel, I thought—I
thought it was pretty obvious!” he
replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” said Muriel, “I think very
poorly of you for not wishing to marry
her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, good Heavens! Miss Dallerton,”
he cried, now really astonished, “I want
nothing so much! I came here, if you must
know, simply for that purpose! and I find
her—gone—leaving no traces, and, if you
will excuse my saying so, a great deal of
confusion behind her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly do feel confusion, not to say
chaos,” said Muriel smiling; “and the worst
of it is I can’t possibly explain. However
one thing’s evident, if you want her you
must look for her, for I have no address beyond
Paris. She hates writing letters, and
it will probably be a month at least before
she writes and gives it to me. Will you
wait in London?” Leslie Damores smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might find her in Paris, and I shall
not find her here,” he said; “and when I
do find her, I shall bring her back. Good-bye,
Miss Dallerton; I’m glad I didn’t deserve
your scolding this time, it looked as if
it was going to be a pretty bad one. Oh,
but I was a fool for not marrying Cynthia
eight years ago!” Muriel held out both
her hands to him, her eyes filled with
tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad you are going to her,” she
said. “I won’t wish you luck, because
there is something so much better that you
have got already; but I can’t help being a
little sorry, for she will never come back to
me again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you all alone?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s my work,” she said; “and the
blackbeetle, who is a great friend of mine,
and looks after me very well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you remember ‘The Lady of Shalott?’ ”
he asked abruptly. “I always liked
that last line of it, ‘God in His mercy lend
her grace.’ Good-bye, Miss Dallerton.” He
was gone, hopeful and strong once more,
with the possibility of satisfaction within
his grasp, and Muriel again alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was all very well for Launcelot to say
that,” she thought, “but when she needed
him most she had no loyal knight and true,
the Lady of Shalott, and—and not even
God’s grace would make her forget that!”
And Muriel put her arms on the table and
cried a little about Jack—at least she
thought it was about Jack, but it was
really that Cynthia’s hand was on what she
herself had missed. The woman’s lips that
bear no kiss of love seem formed in vain;
even the angels must sigh for them—and
not even the angels satisfy. Yet she had
held it all once, and remorse and passion
and pity mocked at her for having thrown
life’s gift away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the blackbeetle, whose other name
was Catherine Mary, appeared again it was
to bring supper, and a message from a poor
woman that “She was taken cruel bad, and
would Miss Muriel come to her?” Muriel
left her after a terrible four hours. The
fight had given her strength, and the light
in her eyes was wonderful. She had forgotten
all about the Lady of Shalott.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Really</span>, Mary, it’s absurd to stay away
from the picnic! And I simply can’t go if
you won’t. That odious Mrs. Collins makes
the most hateful chaperon, with her ‘Come
here, my dear!’ just at the wrong moments.
<span class='it'>Won’t</span> you come, Mary?” Gladys, in the
most delicate of Dresden flowered silks, with
a huge hat one mass of pale pink roses and
black velvet, looked imploringly at her
companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was a girl it was impossible to describe
without mentioning her clothes. One
felt if she had worn a yachting suit with gilt
buttons she would have looked pathetic.
Mary Huntly took one of the little hands in
hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The truth is, dear—but don’t, please,
tell Tom—I had a slight hæmorrhage this
morning. Nothing much, it is true, but
these tiresome lungs will bother me, and
I know I ought to keep quiet to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You never used to be so fussy about
your health, Mary,” exclaimed the girl
petulantly. There is nothing that so torments
a brave woman as a gibe at nervousness.
It was true that Mary had conquered
her fear, but she knew it to be something
that comes again, and would never while
she lived cease to give up coming. She
winced and let the girl’s hand drop; she
had not voice enough to explain. The persistent
cruel healthiness of the girl before
her aroused in her a kind of defiance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since you are so keen, dear, I will go,”
she said, “but I hope they won’t expect me
to talk!” She laughed huskily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom is out shooting, isn’t he?” she
asked Gladys later as they walked towards
the carriage which was to take them to their
destination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How funny you are, Mary! You never
used to be so interested in Tom’s movements,”
laughed Gladys; “he won’t be
back, I don’t suppose, till long after we
are.” An hour later, by a half-ruined temple,
under the shade of great enshrouding
trees, Jack Hurstly sitting beside Gladys
asked her a little sharply if her cousin wasn’t
very seedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, poor dear!” said Gladys with the
wistful, pathetic look that had helped to
draw Mary to the picnic; “and she’s
so dreadfully plucky and determined, I
couldn’t persuade her to stay at home with
me. I can’t tell you how anxious it makes
me feel!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack’s eyes grew tender over her. Hats
of a certain shade cast sincerity in a becoming
glow over an upturned face. He
wanted to help her, protect her, comfort
her! His vexation was transferred to Mary.
It must be such a strain to go about with
an obstinate, sick woman. Jim Musgrave
sat by his aunt. All the rest had gone off
somewhere—a general direction to which
all picnics tend where there is no one to
victimize the party with games. Gladys
had promised to go and see an ancient well
with Jim, and she had gone to see it—with
Jack Hurstly; only Mrs. Collins and Jim sat
with Mary. Suddenly she put her hand on
his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim—take—me—home,” she cried. It
was the end of the picnic.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXV</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote20em'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“God’s Hand touched her unawares.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>When</span> Tom Huntly rode home with a big
bag of game after a satisfactory dinner with
a crony it was nearly twelve o’clock. Yet
to his surprise the whole house was lit up,
and there was an uneasy sense of motion
and confusion. He dismounted and called
for a servant. Suddenly he heard a woman
crying. He let the horse go and walked
into the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you expect me to go to her?
No, I won’t! I won’t! Oh, it’s horrid! it’s
terrible!—just when I was so happy too!
No, doctor, go and sit with her till Tom
comes! Oh, my God! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Doctor! here
he is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is my wife?” said Tom Huntly.
The words sounded to his ears like a quotation;
it was absurd to suppose they could
be his. He did not look at Gladys, dissolved
in frightened tears over the inappropriateness
of the angel Death. The doctor spoke
with the unreal cheerfulness of his profession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another hæmorrhage, Major Huntly.
It is over now, but you must expect to find
her a little weak.” Then, as Tom Huntly
uncomprehendingly followed him, “It is
my duty to tell you that I consider her case
serious—very.” A nurse stood by the bed
fanning her. A sudden remembrance of
the boy’s birth (the boy at Eton) swept over
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked very young, with that old,
bright something in her eyes that the last
ten years of the world had managed to dim.
She whispered his name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom, come a little nearer.” He knelt
beside her, and put his arms around her.
They had wasted a lot of time. “I wanted
you so—Tom,” she whispered. “It’s been
such a poor sort of thing, hasn’t it? What
we might have been to each other, I mean?
But it’s been all my fault, dear. I never
knew a man that could have made me half—so
happy. There are not many women
who could say that of their husbands in our—world—are
there, Tom?” She coughed
till the slow breath came back. “So you’ll
not worry, Tom?” she gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mary—Mary, darling—you won’t leave
me and the boy?” It was frightful this
want of time. She smiled bravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so glad you care,” she murmured.
“Tell him—Tom—that his mother says she
wants him to be—a gentleman—like his
father.” The nurse stepped forward, but
the doctor shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no need,” he said, but he meant
“There is no hope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Mary! Mary!” She opened her
eyes again: she was much too tired to be
frightened of death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>God takes the ignorant, plucky souls who
have fought the good fight, not quite knowing
why, very peacefully to Himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like,” she gasped, “more air.”
The nurse came towards her bed with the
fan in her hand, but before she could reach
her a gust of wind strangely cool and fresh
swung the curtains of the window, and
Mary Huntly was dead, having passed from
a life which stifled, limited and kept back
all the highest and noblest in her to beyond
the horizon where “Over all this weary
world of ours breathes diviner air.” The
room was very quiet and still. The doctor
after a few words to the nurse, engaging her
for another case, went off to his quarters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gladys composed two heart-broken notes
to Jack Hurstly in her sleep, and Tom
Huntly left alone with the body of the
woman he loved fought the old fight with
the grimness of things.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXVI</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“And Memory fed the Soul of Love with tears.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Too</span> late!” is a phrase holding the eternal
knell of life. It sounds like a muffled peal
even to those who hear it lightly said. To
those who have lived through it, the worst
of the battle passes before their eyes again.
Many, perhaps blissfully, miss all that it
means. They dare not, or cannot, face remorse.
That they themselves have pulled
down their house about their ears seems to
them an infamous impossibility. They forget
all their own cruel words, long neglect
and unfair judgment, and only remember
flashes of sunlight which they connect—probably
quite falsely—with themselves.
Their “yesterdays look backward with a
smile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gladys never realized even as much as
a tinge of shame. She cried a great deal.
Mary knew how to manage things so beautifully,
and, better still how to manage Tom.
There was a certain heavy awkwardness
about Tom that Gladys didn’t like. It
had the effect of putting her in the wrong,
which was, on the face of it, absurd. Also
he wouldn’t do what she wished without
coarsely asking “Why.” Altogether, Mary
had taken the edge off a difficulty; and
Gladys hated difficulties almost as much as
she did explanations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was so dreadfully trying, too—Mary’s
dying just then! Another week, perhaps,
and it would not have mattered so much.
The thought forced her to look into the
glass. The crying had done no great
damage; she would dress entirely in white.
Jack would come round soon after breakfast
to find out how Mary was. Oh, poor
Mary!</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something so bald and primitive
and earnest about death; <span class='it'>whatever</span>
happened she would not be taken to see the
body. She went out into the dining-room.
Suddenly she began to be afraid of meeting
Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom had passed the night of a thousand
years; it comes once or even twice in a
lifetime. He was looking very old and
haggard. When Gladys came into the
room he winced as if he had touched a
snake. It was a very awkward meeting.
Tom would have gone out of the room and
said nothing, but there was breakfast—and
the servants. By-and-bye there was only
breakfast, and Gladys sitting where Mary
used to sit. She was thinking that at least
he might have shaved, and wondering if she
dared to speak to him. It was very hot and
still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you know that Mary had had a
hæmorrhage before?” he asked in the dangerously
level tones of passion curbed.
Gladys burst into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you speak of her in that heartless
way, Tom?” she cried. He gave a queer
little sound that might have been a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Answer me,” he said. The question was
how much did he know, and what was the
safest lie? He saved her the trouble.
“Very well, you did know, then! Now how
long has this been going on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was easy enough to keep it from you,
Tom!” she said, with the brutality of a
weak thing cornered. “You never took the
trouble to find out. Poor Mary made me
promise not to tell you. She told me first
in England that her temperature rose every
night, but that she didn’t intend to make
herself an invalid for that. She said you
were the sort of man who hated invalids.”
Tom broke a paper-cutter he had been
playing with on the table. “I don’t know
how many hæmorrhages she had—not very
many; certainly not one for a long
time——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not one yesterday morning,”
he interrupted slowly, a little pause between
each word. “Before you went to the
picnic?” Gladys looked desperately at the
paper-cutter. There was something in the
psalms about a green bay-tree that occurred
to her, not of course in connection with herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, she never said so. She wanted
particularly to go to the picnic; she said
(who was it that said women are no inventors?)
that she would be so dull without
you. I tried to persuade her not to go, but
she would——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” said Tom meditatively,
“how many lies you have been telling me?
Don’t get angry, it really isn’t worth while,
and it doesn’t matter in the least, you know,
only you had better save some for your old
age. You can pack your things, as we are
going home next week.” He rose drearily
from the table and made his way out of the
room; he cared so very little about anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt as physically tired as after a
forced march. An endless expanse of days
and months and years passed before his
eyes—there seemed so much time now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly he thought of the boy!—Mary’s
boy and his. He straightened himself up;
there was still somebody left to do that for.
For Mary’s sake he would devote himself to
the boy; it was tremendously worth while.
He sat down and painstakingly wrote a
letter that made his own tears come and the
boy’s when he read it, and drew the two together
as nothing but sorrow and loneliness
and love can ever do. It followed so
naturally and plainly that if Mary wanted
her son to be like his father, the father must
try to be a better sort of chap. Remorse
receded, and took with it the burden of
hopelessness.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gladys</span> went into the garden, where it was
coolest and shadiest, and sat, a lovely and
pathetic figure, leaning, it is true, against a
cushion with her listless hands in her lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Captain Hurstly found her. She had
written the little heart-broken note, and
she rose to meet him with quivering lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Jack, Jack!” she murmured—in
an abandonment of grief Christian names
fall so naturally, and it sounded very sweet
to Jack—“how good of you to come!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good of me?”—he held both her hands;
she had given them to him unconsciously—“I
think it was awfully sweet of you to see
me—I’m so sorry, dear—so sorry!” The
tears rolled down her cheeks. She looked
very pretty when she cried, and it was very
difficult not to kiss her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mary was everything I had in the
world,” she said withdrawing her hands
with a swift blush, and sinking back on the
cushions again—“mother, sister, friend.
And Tom—Tom has been so brutal to me
Oh, what shall I do, what shall I do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom brutal to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! he hates me. I’m sure I don’t
know why. Perhaps he feels now he might
have done more for Mary. She told me
often how terribly lonely she was before I
came to her. We are to go back to England
next week, and I know too well what
that means!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does it mean?” he asked looking
at her long and carefully, the white dress
that fell away from the little fair throat,
the pathetic quiver of the dainty mouth,
the hopeless, hunted look in the big dark
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I can’t tell you!” she cried with a
sudden gasp. “Don’t—don’t ask me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must know,” he said firmly; “tell me,
please.” The color swept over her cheeks,
her eyes faltered and fell before his, her
hands trembled in her lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom wants me to marry,” she said at
last, “a man I can never—love.” She
covered her face with her hands. “Go
away!” she cried piteously. “Isn’t it hard
enough already without making me tell—you!”
She gasped the word containing her
passionate heart. She was in earnest now,
that was why she hid her face; she knew
that she would not be so pretty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The word that fell in the hot still morning
lived ever afterwards in Jack’s mind with
the heavy scent of tropical flowers, the restless
quiver of the air, and the sharp metallic
stroke of a coppersmith’s beak near by.
She was unhappy, and pretty, and clinging—and
she loved him. Had he any right to
make her love him so, and then leave her to
a bitter and miserable marriage? So pity
spoke, and the beauty of the girl’s lithe
form, the curl of hair just escaping the uplifted
hand, the delicate scent she used, the
whole scene with its setting of the old hot
Indian garden spoke to passion. And when
pity and passion speak at the same moment,
reason, sense, and self-control fade fast
away. He took her hands from her face;
she looked at him as a startled child would
look; he felt the beating of her heart; he
drew her closer to him, and she made no resistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gladys, Gladys, will you be happy with
<span class='it'>me</span>, darling?” he asked her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Jack!” she cried, “you never even
asked me—if I loved you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour later, radiant, triumphant, cruel,
Gladys stood before Tom Huntly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not going back to England with
you,” she said. “I am going to marry Jack
Hurstly. I shall stay with Mrs. Collins till
the wedding, and come home with Jack, for
good.” Tom Huntly looked at her, alive
and young! and upstairs lay the body of
his wife, and the girl could be so happy!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you quite heartless?” he asked
wearily. The insolence of her joy turned
to weak self-pity, and she began to cry
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, poor, poor Mary!” she sobbed.
“She <span class='it'>so</span> wanted to help me choose my
trousseau!” Tom left the room, shutting
the door after him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack went back to his quarters. He
wondered why the scent she wore seemed
so familiar. He remembered at last that
Edith le Mentier had used it too, and he
remembered at the same time with equal
irrelevancy that Muriel never used scent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening he had a long talk with Tom
Huntly. His friendship with Mary had
been a deep and real one, and he thought
Gladys must have been mistaken about
Tom’s brutality. He was not that sort of
man; and he thought Tom was equally mistaken
when he said rather doubtfully, “I
hope you will be happy with Gladys; she’s
not half up to the form of that other girl of
yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Any reference to Muriel was peculiarly
irritating to him just now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It also seemed that people who knew
Gladys very well did not appreciate her so
deeply as people who knew her slightly—a
trait which is certainly a trifle unfortunate
in a man’s future wife. But he had burned
his boats, and he remembered how pretty
she was, and tried to think it very natural
that the day after his engagement he should
find his <span class='it'>fiancée</span> playing love-songs on the
piano to her very distant connection, Jim
Musgrave.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXVIII</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote20em'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“Is she not pure gold, my mistress?”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Jim</span> looked at his uncle and said nothing.
The two men were smoking on the piazza.
It was late evening, the day before Major
Huntly was to sail for England. He had
just mentioned Gladys’ engagement, and
found that his nephew knew nothing about
it. Jim grew rather white, and the two
puffed steadily at their pipes again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She ought to have told you,” said his
uncle at last. “Does it make a lot of difference?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Jim laconically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to bother you, old fellow,
but I think I ought to know did she give
you any reason to think——” Jim shook
his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—I was simply—a fool,” he said
shortly; and then he added with a rather
bitter smile “she wasn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But now, you know,” said his uncle,
“you’ll shake it off, I hope; there’s as good
fish in the sea, you know, as ever came out
of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And they can stay there,” said Jim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you don’t mean you still care for
her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, I always shall—whatever she
does!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night was radiant. Full in the starlit
sky the moon poured forth a clear stream of
light, bringing out the colors of the world
thinly, not as the sun does, but with a
strange, mystic richness all her own. The
two men had not poetic temperaments.
Nights and moons and stars were much
alike to them, and they were not thinking
just then so much of each other’s sorrows,
chiefly of their own. Yet there was a very
warm feeling of sympathy between them,
and they sat for some time longer smoking
in silent fellowship. At last Jim rose to his
feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be on duty to-morrow, sir,” he
said, “so I’m afraid I shan’t see you again.
You’ll drop me a line when you’ve reached
home, and tell me how you find the little
chap?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Jim. I say, old fellow, I wish
Mary was here to-night, she’d know what
to say to you. I’m afraid I shall only make
a mull of it—you’ve faced your guns pluckily
about Gladys—don’t take it too hard;
and if I could do any good at seeing your
colonel about getting you some shooting
leave——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, sir,” Jim interrupted; “it’s
awfully good of you. I think perhaps
there’s an opening for me to go to the front
again, a fellow of ‘ours’ is taken with enteric
out there. I’ll get along all right—and you
know what I feel about aunt Mary. She
was too good a woman to make me lose my
faith in them, and it wasn’t Gladys’ fault,
sir—it was all mine. You won’t blame her,
will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I won’t blame her,” said his uncle
shortly—“good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, sir,” and Jim, sternly setting
his shoulders with all an Englishman’s passionate
determination to suppress his emotion,
passed out into the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the same beautiful world when
earlier in the evening he had enjoyed a talk
with his lady-love, and had said that he
thought the world was really “an awfully
jolly place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would believe no wrong of her now—it
is love’s creed for the young—only the
world was a beastly hole—that was all; and
it was hard lines on a chap to have to come
into it whether he would or no. His grief
rushed him into metaphysics, an unknown
quality to Jim, and he felt more himself
again when he had applied for leave—and
got it—to be sent to one of the most unhealthy
parts of India where there was a
little row on.</p>

<div class='blockquote20em'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“What matter how little the door, if it only lets you
in!”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Paris</span>, always in a glitter, struck both Cynthia
and Geoffrey as being almost too emphatically
the same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They separated after the dear, delicious
lightness of the earliest French meal, one
to go to the studios and try to get a skilled
but unpractised hand in again, the other
whimsically to the lecture-rooms, an atmosphere
congenial, but thin and uncolored
to one fresh from the active fight. So the
first week passed, and quite unconsciously
they began to imbibe the gay French surface,
the triumphant shrug at the disagreeable,
the bright intensity of the absorbing
present. It was not that they forgot or felt
less, but as if straight from the seriousness
of the downstairs rooms they had strayed
into the nursery and were playing at being
children again. It was one morning on her
way to the studio that Cynthia met an old
acquaintance of hers, an emphatic American
girl, who exclaimed in the arresting
tones of her countrywomen:⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Cynthia Grant, is that you!”
Cynthia turned smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Millicent!” she said, “in Paris?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, certainly,” laughed Millicent
gayly; “didn’t you know I was married. I
couldn’t keep it up any longer. You remember
Clifton Perval? He was that set!
I <span class='it'>had</span> to give in to him! But come right
away home with me, Cynthia; I’ve the most
perfectly lovely flat you ever saw!” Cynthia
felt suddenly human.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” she said, “I’ll give myself
a holiday. So you are actually <span class='it'>living</span> in
Paris. You always wanted to, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Want</span> to? I was just crazy. But I let
my husband know I’d be planted <span class='it'>here</span> or
nowhere! So we just came. Launcelot
will be just as pleased to see us——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is Launcelot?” laughed her friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My little boy. Why, didn’t I tell you?”
Her bright, keen face clouded a little. “Yes,
I’ve got a child.” She paused flatly, and
then fell back with ready gush on an easier
line. “Don’t you think Launcelot a real
pretty name? I told Clifton I’d take
nothing common. No William-George effects
for me! So his name is Launcelot
Cummins Perval. Cummins was my name,
you remember, before I married. Oh, here
we are. Now isn’t it a charming location?
It’s so sweet and central.” Cynthia nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were taken up almost to the top of
a high building. The flat was evidently
small and inexpensive. As they entered
Cynthia was struck with the effect of an
aggressive effort to conceal. Everything
seemed unnaturally placed so as to hide
something else, and to block views. There
were a quantity of unnecessary things, and
some very bad pictures. Millicent had
never had much art though she had a great
deal of talent, but the talent had deteriorated
and the art vanished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sitting on the floor, his head a mass of
dark curls, with wide, blue, astonished eyes,
was a little fellow of about six, in quaint,
tight black velvet trousers. He looked at
his mother wistfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said he would come back,” he
exclaimed sorrowfully; “but he hasn’t for
hours and hours!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Launcelot, how silly you are,”
cried his mother; “come here, right away,
and shake hands with this lady. Aren’t
you <span class='it'>glad</span> to see mother come home so
soon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child rose obediently and advanced
towards Cynthia. His eyes were heavy
with the difficulty to express his thoughts,
his eyebrows were knitted painfully. Cynthia’s
eyes grew tender as they met his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you lost, sonnie?” she asked
gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s Tony that’s goned away,” he
began eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The child’s bird escaped out of the
window this morning,” his mother explained
contemptuously; “Marie opened
the cage, or something. The thing squealed
awfully; it’s rather a relief. Now, Launcelot,
you go back to your bricks, and mother
will give you some candy by-and-bye.”
But Cynthia held the child’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to hear about Tony,” she said
firmly. The boy’s eyes were full of tears,
but he controlled himself manfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If God has taken him,” he said, “I
think it’s very selfish. God has birds and
birds, and I only had Tony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Launcelot Perval,” exclaimed his
mother in shocked tones, “whatever do you
mean? You’re a very naughty boy to talk
so; mother’ll have to punish you if you say
such things.” The boy ignored his mother.
She might have been an intrusive fly. He
brushed her away. Cynthia understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But perhaps God didn’t take him,” she
suggested thoughtfully. The boy’s face
brightened, but clouded again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He lives in the sky,” he said; “and that’s
where Tony went. He must have flown
straight to God, and I think God <span class='it'>ought</span> to
have sent him back,” his lips quivered
again. “I’ve waited hours and hours,” he
repeated mournfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God has got such a lot of things to do,”
she said, “perhaps He will send him back
to-morrow. Don’t you think you could
wait till to-morrow, Launcelot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, really, Cynthia,” laughed her
friend, “I can’t let you encourage the child
in such notions. Now, look here, Launcelot,
if you will be a good boy, and not worry
any more, I’ll ask papa to buy you another
Tony.” She was a good-natured woman,
but she missed the point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but there isn’t another Tony,” he
said looking at his mother reproachfully;
“there aren’t two mes nor two Gods,
mama?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do be quiet, Launcelot,” she cried
falling back on the dense weapon of her
authority; “of course there aren’t two Gods.
I shall send for Marie to take you away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This threat closed the discussion. The
child went back to the window, and gazed
wistfully at the roofs, still wondering at his
unanswered prayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Millicent showed Cynthia her flat. Cynthia
began to understand the pathetic
concealments. They were very poor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We manage to have good times,
though,” Millicent explained. “We get
around and see things. Men don’t like
women being <span class='it'>too</span> economical, and I don’t
believe in it myself. They just spend and
spend, and then make a row over the bills.
I don’t see why we shouldn’t spend too; it
don’t make much more of a row, for they
put it down to us anyway! But it’s very
unfortunate our having that child!” She
cast an impatient glance at the little fellow
in his odd-shaped, out-grown clothes.
“Sometimes I positively don’t know which
way to turn. His father and I don’t know
what to make of him—he’s that funny!
It doesn’t rightly seem as if he was our
child!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a dear little fellow,” said Cynthia
pityingly; “I wish you would let me take
him home for this afternoon, I would bring
him back at bedtime. I shall be all alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, that’s real sweet of you, Cynthia,”
said Mrs. Perval. “Clifton and I want so
much to have a nice afternoon with some
French friends of ours—Monsieur le Comte
de Mouselle and his sister. He’s the most
perfectly charming man. Do you know
him?” Cynthia shook her head. Millicent
tittered. “He’s just wild about <span class='it'>me</span>,” she
said, “but of course I know how to deal with
him. <span class='it'>They</span> can’t take me in, you bet! but
I’ll be real pleased,” she added, seeing
Cynthia’s attention wander, “to let you
have Launcelot for this afternoon as soon
as Marie can get him ready.” Ten minutes
later the two left the flat. Mrs. Perval, her
hands on her hips, talking to them as they
went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Launcelot, be sure you’re a good
boy, and mind what you say. Cynthia,
don’t let him worry you—please. I’ll be
<span class='it'>real</span> pleased to see your brother again,
Cynthia. Give him my love, and tell
him——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever she was to tell him was lost on
the way downstairs. Cynthia and the boy
felt suddenly free, their eyes sparkled, they
clasped each other’s hands tightly—the
world lay before them, the great glittering
Paris world, rich with delights. A French-woman
with bright, bright eyes passed
them. The boy pressed a little closer to
Cynthia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The streets roar so,” he said fearfully.
“Do you think it’s at all likely there’s any
lions about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are always careful to shut them
up,” Cynthia explained, “when boys go out
with friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had a wonderful lunch and lots of
marvellous French cakes, and if there were
any lions they remembered that “friends”
didn’t like them, and kept within bounds.
Cynthia felt for the first time that she could
breathe without it hurting her. To be alive
and separate is so terrible to love. The
child’s hand in hers made her look past
herself into a world more beautiful and infinitely
higher than her dreams.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXX</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote20em'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“Oh; the light, light love that has wings to fly!”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Dr. Grant</span> had not found the wrench of
parting much easier than his sister, but, like
many people with deep emotions, he had
found room enough to keep his unhappiness
apart from his everyday work and appearance,
and to take a certain amount of placid
enjoyment out of his new mode of living.
The difficulty was in completely deceiving
Cynthia by the constant holiday aspect she
expected of him. Sometimes the shadow
fell between them, and they would be silent
and apart, then both would bitterly blame
themselves, pity each other, and rush back
into the holiday aspect again. They would
have been far happier if they had been less
reserved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was about six when Geoff, returning
to their apartments, heard the noise of talk
and merry laughter in his sister’s room. He
opened the door hastily to find Cynthia on
her knees before the fire roasting chestnuts
with a curly-headed youngster, who laughed
the more at his appearance, as if it were a
part of the game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the Knight Sir Launcelot,” said
Cynthia gravely, waving her hand towards
the boy. “Launcelot—the King!” Launcelot
nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always ’spected him,” he said earnestly,
“and now God must have sent him
instead of Tony. Do you think kings are
nicer than birds?” he added anxiously to
Cynthia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not most of them,” said Cynthia preparing
to shell a hot chestnut; “but mine’s
a very nice king, as nice as any bird I should
think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Things when they’re <span class='it'>very</span> nice fly away,”
puzzled the thoughtful knight; “if kings
<span class='it'>was</span> as nice as birds they might fly too!”
He drew down his brows and gazed at the
solid and substantial doctor. “But you—you
don’t look as if you was a very flying
person,” he finished triumphantly. “Would
you like a chestnut?” The doctor accepted
one with enthusiasm, and Launcelot, the
king and the woman with red hair spent a
charming and exciting evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They only parted at bedtime at his
mother’s door on the express understanding
that he was to come again the next day, and
that knights never even under the hardest
circumstances cried, and that last, but not
least, the coal-black charger with a stiff neck
under the king’s coat transported thither
from a fairy shop must be shown without
delay to Marie, daddy and the cook. These
facts being grasped the worst was over, and
the knight, strewing wet kisses in his wake,
was borne away to bed, leaving his volatile
mother expressing shrill-voiced thanks to
Cynthia and Geoff. The streets seemed ten
times brighter and less chilly to the doctor
and his sister, and they went to a screaming
French farce for the rest of the evening, and
felt much the better for it. In fact they
even forgot for a while their determination
to enjoy themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this it became the custom for
Launcelot to go to Cynthia every afternoon
and stay with her till evening. Millicent
was always grateful, but frequently hurried—more
hurried even than an American
woman in Paris generally is. She did not
refer again to the charming Count and his
sister, but one day she told Cynthia that
“Clifton had gone away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For how long?” asked Cynthia quietly.
Millicent stared, then she sat down and
laughed. She laughed for a long while, but
not very merrily. Finally she explained
with a blank terseness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s just quit; he’s gone! he’s left me.
Don’t stand there and stare, Cynthia. Sit
down. We didn’t have a very good time
together.” She continued pacing restlessly
up and down the little tawdry room. “He
was always the sort of man that wanted a
good time, and we didn’t have much money.
After the child came, you know, it was
worse than ever. I wasn’t going to play
the door-mat to Clifton, but I did my best
to make it pretty.” She looked at the little
concealments, ragged and thin in the heartless
Paris sunshine, and they looked more
pathetic than ever. “And I dressed real
well, but there wasn’t any keeping him.
He only told me I was ruining him with
dressmakers’ bills, though he knew I make
the most of my own clothes! Sometimes I
wish I hadn’t been so cock-sure about Paris.
In America there’d have been something to
keep him back, but there’s nothing to keep
one back in Paris. Things look as innocent
and pretty——” her voice broke; “but they
aren’t, Cynthia—they’re real mean! they’re
real mean!” Cynthia sat silently gazing at
the carpet. The nervous, breaking voice,
the frightened, restless figure were not lost
upon her. They seemed familiar somehow,
quite as if she had seen them before; and
the ring of pain in the most meagre phrase
“But they aren’t—they’re real mean!
they’re real mean!” voiced a feeling that
had once been part of her without a voice.
She waited for the inevitable sequel. It
came in a burst of hysterical sobs. “He
left me a note, Cynthia—Clifton did—he
said I should know where to look for consolation!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The brute!” cried Cynthia. Millicent
laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well! don’t you know they’re all that
way when a man is tired. Nothing will
keep him; and then he wants to throw a
sop to something, maybe he thinks it’s his
conscience, so he invents another man for
the woman he’s left—if—if there isn’t one
already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Millicent,” Cynthia stood up, and took
the pretty, heavily ringed hand in hers,
“do you think the second man will bring
you anything better than the first? He
never does—the only difference is he leaves
you worse. Stick to your art and Launcelot!”
Millicent tore her hands away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw! you’re always talking about the
child—I hate him!—there!—I hate him!
I hated the pain, I hated being put aside,
I hated having to spend my time on him—maybe
if he hadn’t come Clifton would have
been different; maybe other things would
have been different too! As for my art, as
you call it, what is art to a woman? Why,
it’s nothing! you know it, Cynthia. If
Leslie Damores hadn’t played the fool——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” Cynthia stammered in a piteous
attempt to hide the pain of his name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then! If a man wanted you, I’d
like to know what pictures would mean?
Pictures! I may be weak and silly—I
know I am—I loved my husband. Yes! I
did! I know I did. But if I can’t have
him, I must have somebody. And you
want me—to paint! Well! I’ll tell you. I
wanted to please Clifton—so I painted.
Now the Count doesn’t like the folks I mix
with——” she bridled perceptibly, and
Cynthia felt sick, “so I won’t paint any
more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at the clock. Cynthia gazed
at her desperately; she heard Launcelot’s
voice in the next room. She had taught
him “Sir Galahad,” and his voice rose in a
triumphant shout at the last words, “All
arm’d I ride, whate’er betide, until I find
the Holy Grail!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do with the
child?” she asked wearily. Millicent flushed.
No woman is without the saving grace of
feeling, through some chord, a touch of
shame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Count,” she said, “says he’ll send
him to school; he’s very kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very,” said Cynthia dryly. “He will
send him to a French school, where he will
grow into a second Count—it’s very kind of
him. Millicent, if you have no other plan,
will you give him to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To you!” said Millicent—“to you?”
She was astonished. She was, after all,
his mother, and even where motherhood
brings no love it keeps its sense of property.
“Why, Cynthia, I don’t know as I <span class='it'>can</span>;
you see, after all, I’m his mother! It’s
very kind of you, Cynthia—but——” She
looked again at the clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here!” said Cynthia suddenly,
“I’m not going without the boy. You had
better make up your mind to give him to
me. You don’t want to ruin his life as well
as your own, and if you don’t let me have
him——” Cynthia’s eyes flashed. “He
will be more in your way than ever now.
I shall stay and—explain—to the Count!”
she finished grimly. Millicent turned
white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, go!” she said. “For Heaven’s
sake go, and take the boy with you. I
suppose you don’t know what people will
say! I suppose it doesn’t matter to you
that we all know why Leslie Damores didn’t
marry you. I suppose——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lady Beautiful!”—the knight
stood looking from one to the other at the
door—“Lady Beautiful, do you know where
it is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where what is, my darling?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Holy Grail,” said the knight
wrinkling his brows. “I don’t know where
to find it.” Cynthia took his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s go and look for it,” she said; “it
isn’t here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hesitated, but Millicent stood at the
window with her back to them. She put
her hands to her hair and replaced a pin.
Cynthia turned with the boy, and together
they left the little tawdry flat for the last
time; left the strange, sad life with its
shattered opportunities and sordid concealments;
left his mother standing by the
window waiting for the Count.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This brief but characteristic epistle rung
in Muriel’s head as she left the club for the
night. It was a trying time to leave the
work. She had almost a settlement now of
new helpers, men and women, all under her
headship, devoted and earnest workers, but
needing direction, and a firm, experienced
hand. Cyril Johnstone had volunteered to
come to her. Association with her having
convinced him that she was neither light-minded
nor superficial, and that in spite of
his exalted office he still had something to
learn from a woman. Captain Hurstly having
withdrawn his liberal subscription, the
club-work in his parish had fallen through,
and the old, broad-minded, empty-headed
vicar could jog on in peace to his grave with
a sly chuckle or two at the fizzling out of
modern efforts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile honest hard work and the
buffeting experience of the working-man
had opened the young curate’s mind and
sobered his heart, and there is no such
worker in any cause as the disciplined
enthusiast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel was happier about her work than
she had ever been. It was only right,
according to her ethics, that as satisfaction
dawned the new call should come. She did
not know what her uncle’s illness meant,
but she settled work for the next few weeks,
had a final talk with her new associate, and
putting on what she called her society dress
drove off in a hansom to her uncle’s. She
found him in the comfortable stage of a
dressing-gown and hot chocolate. He closed
his eyes as she entered the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Muriel, is that you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear; I came at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you had not come it would have been
too late! Muriel shut the door!” Muriel
shut the door. The room was very warm,
and the bright winter sunshine lit up the
gold in her hair, and brought out the smile
which was always latent in her eyes. She
sat down by him and took his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have they made your chocolate nicely?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never! Of course they haven’t. I am
infamously neglected. My slightest wish is
thwarted. I am not master in my own
house, Muriel! That is why I sent for you.
You at least, before you became so selfish
and absorbed in your own pleasure, knew
how to look after my comfort. The doctor
says I must on no account move. I suffer
agonies from my foot, and if anything was
to upset me the gout might fly to my heart!
Yet though I have spoken about it again
and again, they <span class='it'>will</span> leave skin on my hot
milk!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I make you some more chocolate,
and boil the milk myself?” asked Muriel
smiling. He growled an affirmative. And
Muriel, chatting brightly about his favorite
topics, made him fresh chocolate, and
lightened the room by certain little readjustments
of flowers, books and cushions
that the eyes of the most diligent of servants
always just miss over, as if to prove that
self-help smiles after all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Arthur Dallerton had aged terribly.
Death’s hand rested upon so much that was
mortal. It is only in such cases that death
is dreadful. Muriel, who had so often seen
it, thought she had never seen it more sadly,
for in his eyes was the haunting fear from
which there is no escape. Later on in the
evening he called her to him. She had been
singing over some old Scotch airs. She came
and sat on a footstool at his feet, with her
head on his knee. He liked to stroke her
hair and hold her hand; it gave him a sense
of peace and security.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Muriel,” he said, “do you think there is
any chance of—anything happening to
me?” The verb “to die” is terrible to some
people. Sir Arthur Dallerton preferred the
evasion of something happening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, no, dear; what should—happen?”
said Muriel smiling. “Things—sad things
might cease to happen for you; but that
would be beautiful, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Muriel, I don’t want to die! I am
afraid! afraid!” His voice rose almost to
a scream. She stroked his hand and
soothed him as if he were a frightened
child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, there, dear heart! it won’t hurt
you, see; there isn’t any death, or anything
to be afraid of, surely! Only light, peace
and rest, dear uncle, and all the beautiful,
lovely things of earth quite free, and nothing
to hurt any more!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Muriel, child, do you think I shall
see people whom I’ve come across in life?
Oh, it’s awful!” The poor, silly, selfish life,
held hopelessly before his eyes by the Inexorable
Reality, made him catch his breath.
The girl’s heart sank, but she spoke with
firm assurance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall meet nothing that we can’t
bear—nothing that is too hard for us—for
God is just as strong to save after death as
before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if there isn’t any God, if there’s only
an awful grave? Oh, Muriel, it’s a dreadful
thing to be an old man!” He shivered
from head to foot, and she nestled closer to
his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The body dies, and never feels anything;
it’s just a sleep, and it will never dream, or
wake, or fret and trouble any more, and we
believe that the spirit is safer without it,
and close to God,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not so sure of that,” said her
uncle sharply. “Some spirits can’t help
it. They’re no better than they should be,
and what do you think happens to them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blind cannot see. It is a scientific
fact and a living reality; the nearest they
can reach to sight is to feel that they do not
see as much as they might see, and they dim
that view by the cry of the eternally inadequate
“I can’t help it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel pressed her lips to the poor human
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear uncle, such spirits must be made
as well as they ought to be. We must trust
God for the method, for we can’t know what
is best; but I am quite sure God meant us
all for His, and if we hold fast to that we
shall grow like Him in time, and He will
give us time, for there is all eternity for us
to go on being good in if we have made the
start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll never leave me, Muriel? Promise
you will never leave me!” There was a
moment’s pause, while she looked into the
fire and watched the red-hot coal grow black
and drop to ashes in the grate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll never leave you, dear,” she said at
last. “And you won’t be afraid any more?”
she questioned. “I shall sleep right in the
next room to you if you want me. You
won’t be afraid?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, child! It’s been very lonely without
you, and they’re very thoughtless about my
chocolate. But you don’t think there’s any—hell,
do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, dear; I am quite sure there’s
not. Now don’t you think I’d better ring
for Thomas to carry you to bed, and I’ll see
that the cook does your broth nicely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may if you like,” he said grudgingly;
“and mind you come to bed early,
and come to me the moment I call you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear, I will,” and she kissed him
gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a good child,” he murmured
sleepily. Just as she closed the door he
called her back. “Muriel!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, uncle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure about what you just
mentioned, you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nothing in all the world or out
of it but God, be very sure,” she said with
the passionate certainty of her faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was not quite certain whether he liked
that very much better either. But his
broth was just as he wished that evening,
and he did not call her in the night for he
passed away peacefully in his sleep. And
there was no dark left but his own soul, and
even that with the hope of light in it passed
into the eternal.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Muriel</span> woke up to a new poverty and
an extra ten thousand a year. The latter
scarcely passed through her mind, but the
former made her terribly lonely. Now there
seemed nothing left, and the world a vast
cold place void of personality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She repeated three times over during a
hurried, lonely breakfast that she had her
work, and the post brought her two letters,
one with Cynthia’s Paris address, the other
in a handwriting that drew all the blood to
her heart. She put it aside and read
Cynthia’s. It told of her work and of
Launcelot. The tone was softer than usual.
Muriel was scarcely surprised when she read
“Launcelot says his prayers every evening,
and always goes to church on Sundays. So
I do, too. His soul wants nourishment as
well as his body, and I promised to take
care of him. The other night Geoff took
him to bed, and when I went up to look at
them they were kneeling side by side looking
out of the window. Launcelot has an
idea that the Holy Grail is in one of the
stars, and he is always looking for it. You
have found it, Muriel, dear, and I am beginning
to believe that some day I may find it
too.” She did not mention Leslie Damores;
evidently he had not discovered her yet.
Muriel hesitated to send him Cynthia’s
address; she believed it better for them
both to wait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally she took up the second letter.
“Will you forgive me for writing to you?
Gladys and I are married. We have left
India for good, which means my profession
dropped, you understand; but Gladys says
there is no one to dress for in India. You’ll
think it awful cheek on my part, but she’s
very young yet, and you used to have a
tremendous influence over her. I suppose
you couldn’t drop in now and then and give
her a hint or two? I should like to see you
awfully.—<span class='sc'>Jack.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel carefully put the letter on a table,
and sat with her hands on her lap gazing
steadfastly into the fire. She saw three
things, and she saw them plainly. One was
that Jack did not love his wife, another
that she, Muriel, had hardly forgiven
Gladys, and thirdly that Jack would like to
see her awfully. There was a dim, shadowy
fourth, but this she brushed angrily away;
it hinted that there was more sunlight
in the room than before she had read the
letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally she drifted into a compromise it
would do no harm to see Gladys. She wrote
telling her of her loss and inviting her to
tea the following week. She was very
nervous when the afternoon came, and
paced restlessly up and down the long reception
room in her heavy black dress vexed
with her expectancy, listening to the noises
in the street. The sharp jingle of a hansom
passing, hesitating, stopping, brought her
to a chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came the sound of an electric bell,
and a minute later the door swung open and
a footman announced “Captain Hurstly,
miss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel looked at him inquiringly. She
did not appear in the least nervous now, for
natures that tremble at a hindrance rise
triumphantly to meet a calamity, and in a
moment she realized that his presence was
fully that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gladys couldn’t come at the last minute,
and I did want to see you so, Muriel,” he
explained. He pleaded as he had always
done, and he was just as handsome. She
let these things have full weight with her
before she spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you sit down, Captain Hurstly;
they will bring tea in a minute. I am sorry
your wife could not come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack looked at her with eloquent, grieved
eyes, but she meeting them saw the coward
in his soul, and her face hardened. He had
not cared enough for her to remain unmarried,
merely enough to desire a flirtation
after marriage. She had not slept properly
for three nights after she received his letter.
He was the first to find the silence uncomfortable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not sorry she could not come,” he
said with a tender inflection; “I wanted to
see you alone. It is a long while since I
have seen you, Muriel. To me it seems
desperately long, and yet you have not
changed at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are mistaken, Captain Hurstly; I
have changed a great deal. You also
have altered considerably.” Muriel’s tone
was convincing even to herself; she was
beginning to believe she could after all
bear it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is true I have altered,” he replied.
“You alone might know how terribly, but
I suppose it is never wise to follow a wrong
by a folly. Only one can’t help oneself when
one’s world, all that one has ever cared for,
tumbles about one’s ears. Oh, Muriel, how
could you do it! how could you do it!” He
was intensely in earnest; he could always
be that at the very shortest notice. He
stood in front of her looking down with
the same passionate blue eyes which used
to stir her heart, and yet when he met
hers it did not seem as if he was looking
down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you have come to open a question
forever closed between us, Captain Hurstly,
and which your own honor and good sense
should know to be doubly closed by your
marriage, I must ask you to excuse me. I
did not invite your wife to tea as a permission
for you to insult me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right,” he said looking at her
with frank admiration; “you are always
right, Muriel, without you I have forgotten
how to be. Forgive me, I did not
come here to upbraid you for ruining my
life——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think not, indeed,” Muriel
interrupted scornfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But to ask you to help me about Gladys.
Are you my friend enough to wish to do that—Muriel?”
She flushed painfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like to help you,” she said in a
low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s simply that she won’t understand
the danger of flirting with other men—every
and any other man apparently,” he explained;
“and I don’t want my wife to
be a second Edith le Mentier.” There
was a pause; his illustration was unfortunate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You give her no cause to complain of
you by your attention to the—first Mrs.
le Mentier?” she could not forbear to
ask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Muriel!” he cried. The protest was too
vehement to be convincing. She rose and
held out her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will do all I can for your wife, Captain
Hurstly—I am afraid it will be little enough—on
one condition”—he waited anxiously—“that
you will not attempt to see me
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You really mean it?” He spoke slowly,
intensely. She never knew afterwards how
she kept her hands from trembling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have singularly forgotten the little
you knew of me if you think I do not mean
what I say, Captain Hurstly.” She turned
wearily to the door. He compared her in
his mind with Edith le Mentier. Muriel
was telling him to go away. She had told
him to come back. Gladys was only a
shadow in his life, a chained shadow; he
did not even think of her at this moment.
He had never depended on principles or
considered consequences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, then, Muriel,” he said. “I
suppose I must thank you for your promise,
though its condition is terrible to me. You
don’t know what you may be driving me
to!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m not driving you,” cried Muriel
desperately, the weakness of his nature
dawning more fully on her; “drive
yourself, Captain Hurstly—drive yourself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he went, and was driven by some
passion of irresponsibility from Muriel to
Edith le Mentier. He found her in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Muriel there was just earth—weak
earth—where her ideal had once made
heaven for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not often we are brought into such
sharp contact with our broken idols; if it
were we should cease to make new ones—and
that would be a loss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel stood face to face with the knowledge
that she had been a fool—a girl with
a dream—lie—hugged to her heart: and
God help women who have to realize such
dreams in the daylight of facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All she could find to say was that he was
absolutely dead; she had not risen yet to
see her deliverance. If the world had been
empty before, now it was a blank. Those
who die leave a sense of loss, but to know
that one we loved has never lived is the
greatest and most tragic emptiness of all.
Muriel saw failure written over her heart.
There was only one thing left: she fell on
her knees and offered up her failure. So
love passed away from her, but it left her
on her knees.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXXIII</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote20em'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“The black moments at end, the elements change.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was early, and the sunlight with sharp
shadows had a chilly and almost stage
effect. The sky was dazzling over Notre
Dame. Geoffrey Grant sat in the great
church, watching the sunbeams catch up
and glorify the dust. Worshippers and
sightseers slipped in and out, and many
candles gleamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thought of Muriel had driven him
there; and now he was alone with it, he
thought half cynically how many had been
driven there from the effects of unhappy
love affairs, only they had called it aspiration.
He at least was honest with himself;
he knew it was Muriel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his early youth he had been embittered
by a girl. It was the usual story of love
and no money, and the girl had chosen not
to wait. When success and good fortune
came to him, he was indifferent to it. He
treated all women with a sort of good-natured
contempt, thinking them creatures
of diseased nerves and hysterical affections.
Necessary evils distinctly, but of the two
perhaps more evil than necessary. His
sister had been the one exception; he almost
worshipped her. Then came her story.
A crisis which he had passed through, by
an extraordinary power, but once faced, he
had resolutely killed, and hidden all traces
of the past. His sister never knew what
agony she had brought into his life. She
believed that his perceptions were blunted,
instead they were too delicate to be obvious;
he had encased them in reserve, and bore
without wincing because the worst pain
stings into silence. Muriel had been a revelation
to him, her gaiety was so spontaneous,
her brightness so infectious. She had
thrown her life, all dusty and human, into
the glory of the sunbeam, and she was
strong. He had watched her with Jack
Hurstly, and he watched her afterwards.
As a doctor her magnificent healthiness appealed
to him. He could not imagine her
having nervous prostration; as a man he
marvelled at her. She knew that he loved
her, yet she could look him straight in the
eyes and be frankly friendly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had become the purpose of his life to
strengthen their friendship into something
more. For a long while he had struggled
against it, but it was a passion that found
grace with his whole nature; and, when he
had come to the conclusion that strength lay
in submission, Cynthia needed him, and he
laid down his love and his work to face the
Arch Fear of his life. If Cynthia should
fail!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last month had worn lines in his face,
and his keen eyes in repose looked sadder
than ever. He had fought, and the worst
was over; he had watched and fenced,
waited and listened, seized opportunities,
avoided dangers, guided and guarded, and
slaved that Cynthia should be safe and ignorant
of his efforts. He had felt happier
when Launcelot came, and this afternoon
had left her with a mind at rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The figure of a woman with a child in
her arms attracted him. She had evidently
come a long way; she was tired and footsore,
and very poorly dressed. He watched her
buy a candle for the Virgin’s shrine and
kneel there till overcome with weariness,
she slept, her head against a pillar, but even
though she slept she clasped the child. He
felt less impatience than usual with the
wasteful, senseless candle-buying, and the
love, the unconscious love of motherhood,
and all things beautiful touched him closely.
After all, he wondered, there was something
strangely more than human in women who
could give so much as Muriel and that
mother. No physical passion could explain
it all—it was so selfless, so extraordinary, so
unnatural in another mood he might have
called it, but here and now “supernatural”
seemed the more fitting word. The baby
stirred in its sleep, and the mother’s eyes
opened watchfully. She changed its position
to a more comfortable one in her arms,
then she made the sign of the Cross on its
forehead, and crossing herself rose to her
feet and left the church. The doctor rose
too, and then, moved by an emotion he
could never account for knelt and prayed.
He smiled a little whimsically to himself.
“Why, I believe I am becoming a Christian,”
he thought. But he had not changed; he
was only beginning to see what all along
the tremendous struggle of his life had been
making him. People who are so much
better than their creeds often wake up to
find their creeds are higher than they
dreamed.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXXIV</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote20em'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“I shall clasp thee again: and with God be the rest!”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>He</span> had found her! He repeated breathlessly
to himself the one great fact. Leslie
Damores had searched all their old haunts
in Paris, had wandered and waited and
watched, and now at last found her in a
great class-room of French students. He
had come as a special favor to the master
in whose studio they worked, and he could
not signal her out for more than a word, but
by a clever clumsiness he knocked over her
drawing-board. As he picked it up and
gave it to her all the great unspoken things
passed between them. It proved the
mocking inadequacy of words that all he
could say was “When may I see you?” and
that she could only answer “After the
class.” The first blessed moment had gone,
general criticisms had to be given, and
French and English art discussed. An
hour passed interminably; he could not always
stand where the glint of red gold hair
made of the studio a new heaven and a new
earth. Then in a blessed skirmish of conflicting
drawing-boards and parting chatter
the class broke up, and somehow the master
and the pupil found themselves once more
in the streets of Paris, or the new Jerusalem.
There was at that moment ridiculously
little in a name. Their thoughts
were only a happy chaos, and he could do
nothing but repeat the only fact that
mattered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have found you at last,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe you ought to have looked
for me,” she replied gravely, for she was
afraid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What made you run away, Cynthia?”
he asked. She could give him any reason
but the right one. She chose to deny
the charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t run away,” she said; “I merely
wanted to come to Paris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why shouldn’t I look for you?”
cried Leslie triumphantly; “I merely
wanted to come too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know where we are going to,”
said Cynthia, looking at him to see if he was
much altered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think it in the least matters
providing we go there together,” laughed
Damores. “As it happens, here’s a cemetery;
shall we go in and look at the tombstones?”
Cynthia laughed as well. It was
too absurd to think of death. There were
lines in his face; he must have missed her a
good deal. They went into the cemetery
together. A husband who had come to put
some flowers on the grave of his dead wife
thought them heartless. They were not
heartless, they were only too happy to remember
they had hearts at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you have come, what are you going
to do?” she asked at last. She could not
meet his eyes now; the things they meant
cried too loudly for an answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to marry you,” he replied
smiling, “if you’ll let me. I don’t think anything
else matters just at present.” Cynthia
felt the color in great rebellious waves sweep
over her face. She looked with unseeing
eyes at the wreaths of absurdly artificial
flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you fully realize what that means,
Leslie?” she asked. “Can you face everything—everything?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything! everything!” said Leslie
quietly, “with you; without you I cannot
live my life. You are the best of everything
I do. You never came to see my picture—it
would have told you all. Once I made a
tremendous mistake. It seems a crime
when I look back. There is only one thing
that can ever wipe it out. Cynthia, is it too
late to ask you to be my wife, and overlook
the past?” She could not speak, her heart
thundered, and seemed to shake the ground
she stood on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>God had given her a tremendous reward,
a gift unspeakable after she had renounced
what had been to her the very hope of joy,
and from the lips of the man she loved
pardon and oblivion swept her sin into the
free, pure waters of love. She lifted up her
eyes to him that he might read there all her
heart and soul his eternally and for ever.
For a long while silence came down and
covered them. They turned at last, and
slowly and without speaking left the place
of tombs—the acre of God’s sleeping ones.
The man who had been stung by their
laughter, seeing their faces again, recalled
his injury. “After all,” he thought, “they
had their business here.” And he was
right, for love and death live in no separate
houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gladys</span> was desperately unhappy. She
had got what she wanted, and that, unfortunately,
is frequently what follows.
The unscrupulous get much, but they lose
more; and Gladys, who had won her heart’s
desire, sitting in a beautifully furnished
room before the photograph of the husband
she adored, was weeping bitterly.
From the first day of their marriage jars
had arisen. He was hopelessly selfish
about his personal comforts, but he had a
certain tremendous code of honor of the
sort that abhors a lie and connives at a
betrayal. Gladys was given to frequent
fibbing. He had been disgusted, and
had not hidden it; she had been spiteful
and pointedly malicious. Little bitter unspoken
things rose up as their eyes met.
Their honeymoon had not been a success.
(An exacting woman and a selfish man
should avoid honeymoons.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their home-coming was scarcely more so.
They were both very extravagant in different
directions, and they had no patience for
each other’s extravagances and no self-denial
for their own; they were weak and
obstinate over trifles. Gladys was extremely
demonstrative and fond of talking;
Jack cared very little for outward expressions
of feeling, and preferred women who
could hold their tongues. He was perfectly
frank, and paid all his compliments to other
women. Gladys lived on admiration, and
if she could not get it from the man who
ought to give it to her, she would try to
draw it from the man who would. She
found this very easy. A good many of her
husband’s brother officers admired her, and
one of them, a Major Kennedy, frequently
told her so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was crying bitterly now over a note
that lay on her lap. It was an invitation to
a dinner from Edith le Mentier to meet
Major Kennedy. It mentioned her husband
in a way that brought the angry color to
her cheeks. She was beginning to understand,
and the tears dried. She thought
of what Major Kennedy had said of the
way to treat husbands: “Give ’em a little
wholesome indifference, and look round
you; that’s the way to whistle ’em back!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After all, a woman might have a good deal
of fun without any harm coming from it.
Lots of married women did. Look at Edith
le Mentier for instance—hateful thing! Yet
no one could doubt that her husband was
devoted to her—and other women’s husbands
too! Her eyes flashed as she thought
of Jack. She stamped her foot. “I’ll pay
them both out!” she cried, and she accepted
Edith le Mentier’s “delightful invitation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel called on Mrs. Hurstly later in the
season. There was a moment’s silence as
the two women met. The room so daintily
and beautifully furnished seemed filled with
memories. Their eyes were drawn together
to the photograph of Jack Hurstly in uniform.
It was a curious coincidence that he
had given to his wife the very photograph
Muriel had returned to him. It was the
only copy. Muriel withdrew her hand and
sat down with her back to the photograph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And are you going to live in London?”
she asked Gladys, studying the girl’s face,
the defiant sad eyes and peevish mouth, the
fretful restlessness of the dainty figure.
Pity was killing the last traces of her disappointment
in her. Gladys returned her
gaze curiously; she was thinking how becoming
black was to Muriel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes!” she said; “I suppose we shall
practically live here. I hate the country,
you know, except for house-parties, and
Jack’s estate is particularly dreary, I think.
I hate ‘estates,’ they’re like appropriated
pews, one always wants to sit somewhere
else! Have you given up your club craze
yet? Your uncle’s death must have made a
lot of difference to you?” Muriel smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you mean am I horribly rich? I’ll
admit it, but it will make the ‘club craze’
flourish more than ever, I expect. I have
bought up three houses in Stepney and
turned them into one for a settlement of
workers. I am making arrangements now
to enlarge the club, and in two or three
weeks I shall go back to it.” There was a
slight pause. Gladys played with some
violets in a stand. “Are you quite happy?”
said Muriel at last very gently. “I hope,
dear, you are quite happy?” It appeared
to Gladys absurd to suppose she could
possibly mean it, yet the tone sounded
sincere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Happy?—of course we are! Why we
have only been married a few months, and
Jack has discovered I wear my own hair
and keep my own complexion, and I am
reassured as to the harmlessness of his
habits and the extent of his income. What
more can one ask?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those in themselves might add to your
unhappiness if you were so already, but
they could scarcely succeed in <span class='it'>making</span> you
happy, I am afraid,” said Muriel quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t <span class='it'>you</span> be happy with—Jack?”
questioned Gladys. Sorrow, if it doesn’t
increase tenderness, tends to brutality.
Muriel met her eyes calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said slowly, “I do not think I
should be quite happy—with Jack.” She
did not refer to their broken engagement.
Gladys expected her to, and was touched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was horrid of me to say that,” she
said, “if you still care for him, and rude of
me if you don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think you either rude or horrid,”
said Muriel quietly, “only not quite happy.
I am very sorry for you, dear, because,
though I don’t care for Jack as I did, he
made me very miserable once.” Gladys
pulled two violets to pieces on her lap.
Muriel shivered; she hated wanton destruction
of anything, and she loved flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have behaved very badly to you,” said
Gladys at last in a low voice. “It was I
that helped Edith le Mentier make trouble
between you and Jack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You loved him so?” asked Muriel gently.
Gladys burst into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know why you should treat me
like this,” she sobbed, “for I did my best to
ruin your life, and I would again to get—Jack!”
Muriel took her in her arms; all
her old love and pity returned to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would make no difference to me if
you did,” said Muriel; “I should only be
sorry for you. Tell me what’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t care! he doesn’t care!” she
wailed. “I don’t believe he ever did, and
now he’s gone back to that hateful woman
again. Why shouldn’t <span class='it'>I</span> amuse myself if I
want to? He doesn’t love me, and—and
other people do!” Muriel’s face grew stern
with pain. If she had wished for revenge
it was at her feet, but with all her soul she
sorrowed for the wreckage of two lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think you are quite yourself,”
she said. “If you love Jack, you know he
is the only other person there is. He must
have cared for you as well, or he wouldn’t
have married you, dear. So put the other
people quite away, and smile, and wear your
prettiest clothes. You will find Mrs. le
Mentier quite a secondary consideration.
Why, she isn’t even pretty! Jack only
goes to see her because you won’t be nice
to him. Now have you been quite nice to
him? Given up yourself in all the little
ways, that he might give himself up to
you in the great ways? Remember men
are like children: you must put their toys
away, and bring them out again at the right
times, and not fret them about unnecessary
things. Now, put on some of the dear violets
and come home to tea with me!” Gladys
looked at her suspiciously. Muriel laughed.
“There’s nothing I want to get out of you!”
she cried; “and you are no use to me whatever.
<span class='it'>Now</span>, will you come?” Gladys had
the grace to blush; an impulse to trust the
girl she had wronged moved her. She gave
her a letter to read and went out of the
room to get her things on. Muriel read
the letter standing, then she went to the
window and sat down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt very tired. It is not so much of
a surprise to find the outwardly barbarous
with angel hearts, as to see the delicate and
finished products of a noble civilization
inwardly corrupt. The letter was from
Major Kennedy. There are times when
conditional immortality seems the only safeguard
of heaven. Muriel felt too miserable
almost to breathe. There come moments
in the brightest lives of blank depression.
The greatest effort she ever made was to
take Gladys back to tea with her. That
evening Jack Hurstly dined at home, and
his wife burned an unanswered letter.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXXVI</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote20em'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“There is still sun on the wall.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>So</span> Launcelot is to go to school, and
Cynthia is to be married, and you are to be
left all alone?” asked Muriel smiling as she
handed Geoff a cup of tea. She had handed
him a good many cups of tea since he had
been back in England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am to be left all alone,” repeated the
doctor, looking at her steadily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been practically alone ever since
I can remember,” said Muriel suddenly,
“but I have seldom been lonely. In fact
I often think it is only the people who
don’t live alone who <span class='it'>are</span> lonely. They are
always trying to be understood, to break
through barriers and live on a common
level, and there’s no such chance, for the
more one shares the little things the more
pitilessly isolated the big things make us.
It is so dreadfully inadequate that tantalizing
partial help one gets from others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There I think you are wrong,” he said
looking quietly across at her. “It’s the
whole loaf theory you’re defending. You
might just as well say a man had better
have no legs than one, or could be as active
without a crutch as with one, simply because
he can’t be very active anyway.
We all want what help we can get, and it
is not the least necessary for people to
understand us to help us. Children are the
greatest help. People who know that we
want the moon may be wise enough to tell
us it is only a worn-out world of rocks, but
people who can’t fathom our desires can
still help us by telling us it is beautiful.
It is one of the first lessons doctors learn
to help patients to help themselves. In
fact it is the greatest good we or anybody
else can do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet you don’t say that the most ignorant
doctors are the best?” she prevaricated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! because sympathy of that kind
without knowledge is sympathy without
a backbone. Physical cases require the
definite as a foundation, but when one deals
with the invisible, love comes first, not
knowledge. Ignorant mothers mean more
to their children than thoughtful scholars
could—even if they do slap them occasionally.
A man or woman without a home,
if they have no jars and frets, must miss
the influence of it, and feel the horrible
loneliness of life.” He so intensely meant
what he said that Muriel felt she had been
flippant, and yet his seriousness made her
long to be more so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Birds who sit on telegraph wires, and
can fly away from the line of communication
whenever they want to, are more to
my liking,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You forget that the birds have nests,”
suggested the doctor smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you that we don’t have wings,”
sighed Muriel. “And we can’t change our
mates every spring; when we choose we
choose for life, expecting the better—and
getting the worst!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not always,” said Geoff quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel felt angry; she could not tell
why. She had never talked in this strain
before; she felt vicious with the universe,
and its representative opposite her made
her worse; besides she had just been to
see Gladys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there was an alternative we would
take it,” she said. “But half of us women
are brought up in such a lackadaisical way
that there’s no use for us. When we have
brains and opportunity we are generally
physically handicapped. People don’t cut
the woman who works now—they shrug
their shoulders at her, and that’s worse! As
for resources (they advise resources, you
know, after one’s reached twenty-six), they
are an outlet for wasted powers, a puny outlet,
a mere compromise with failure! Oh!
I’ve seen it again and again, dozens of times,
capable, efficient girls brought up to be perfectly,
daintily useless! After the schoolroom
is over they get a dress allowance—and
practise on the piano. Their heads
must be full of something, so then come the
rubbish—heaps of life, silly curates, silly
extravagances, or piteously futile old maidhood!
They keep us from being trained
for anything else because they want us to
marry, but all the other trainings help
towards that the more one learns the more
fit one is to teach. Self-reliance, good judgment
and a sense of proportion are not out
of place in a wife, and motherhood is only a
word without them.” The doctor laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Train your enterprising exceptions,” he
said; “perhaps in time they’ll give the
average woman a lift, but I don’t go all the
way with you by any means. You over-estimate
women because of one or two
women you have met who stand mentally
above their race. Average women at present
haven’t brains enough to seize opportunities
or to apply sensible educations. Domesticities
or resources, and a silly curate or
two, are just what they can appreciate, and
good, solid hard work what they wish to
avoid. I don’t say women lack brains, but
as a rule they lack depth and continuity.
They have very little of the mental soundness,
even the clever ones, that the average
man has as a matter of course. They don’t
concentrate, and they’re altogether too
personal to make much headway in the
professions. You needn’t look as if you
wished to annihilate me, Miss Muriel—I’ve
no doubt you could—but I believe it to be
a fact that women as a whole haven’t got
physical or intellectual stamina enough for
public life, and all the education and
opportunities in the world will never give
it to them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we’re only beginning,” cried Muriel.
“See how far we’ve got already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the worst argument you have
got against you,” said the doctor smiling.
“You are <span class='it'>too</span> quick to be natural; you
work in spurts with reactions—growth, <span class='it'>real</span>
growth, is a much slower affair. But even
granting you that you have been kept back,
you simply can’t be <span class='it'>more</span> mentally than you
have physical strength for, and as long as
you are labelled women, you’ll be labelled
<span class='it'>weak</span>.” Muriel laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You sound so horribly sensible,” she
said, “and you leave us no power!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! there you’re mistaken,” said the
doctor. “All your strength (and Heaven
knows you’ve got enough!) lies in weakness!
When we come to the bottom of it, emotion
rules the world, and woman is queen of the
emotions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, doctor! doctor!” cried Muriel with
uplifted hands. “Principles! principles!”
Geoff smiled grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! principles,” he said; “they are very
good things for theories, and they act as a
drug on the passions—but sometimes they
don’t act! Good-bye, Miss Muriel, my principles
warn me of my office hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel let him go willingly. She felt
absurd, snubbed, dissatisfied. She wanted
some one to look at her as Jack had looked,
with those adoring, humble eyes, and to
listen to her as Jack had listened passionately
sympathetic, and ready to agree with
her that two blacks make the loveliest white
in the world. She hated herself for being
so rubbed up the wrong way; and in one
breath accused Dr. Grant of being rude, and
herself of being ridiculous. Finally she decided
that neither of these things had anything
to do with it, but that she was upset
about Gladys.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>The</span> worst of being unusual,” said Edith
le Mentier to Jack as he talked with her
under the cover of loud, unmeaning drawing-room
music, “is—that’s it’s so common.
Really you know it’s ridiculous running
away. Everybody does it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still you know one can’t come back
again—one’s got to count the cost,” he said
looking at her anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had made him think he cared a good
deal for her, and she cared desperately for
him. He did not realize how much—it was
her greatest victory that he didn’t. She
trembled at even feeling his eyes on her, his
presence near her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel such a brute,” he said, “leaving
Gladys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brutes can’t live with fools,” said Edith
le Mentier. “I like—brutes,” she added
under her breath. Then she looked at him.
“I don’t see the necessity for you to leave—Gladys,”
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The music stopped with a crash. The
hostess cried, “Oh, how delicious! Thank
you! And <span class='it'>which</span> of the dear old masters
was that?” The conversation leaped joyously
into freedom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack felt the room and the plants and the
beautiful dresses whirl round him like a
dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” he said, “I’m not that sort of a
man.” He had risen to the very height
of his standard. Edith understood instantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean,” she said gently and sadly, “we
might never see each other again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Edith! Edith!” he said; “not that, my
darling!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember where you are,” she said in
an undertone. “They’re going to ask me
to sing,” she added. “Come to me to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you would tell me if you mean to
trust me!” he pleaded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shrugged her shoulders; they were
very pretty ones; then she sang. They had
nothing there she knew but Gounod’s
“There is a green hill far away.” And so
she sang that. She sang it beautifully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gladys was sitting up for him, she had had
a headache and could not accompany him.
She always had a headache if there was the
chance of her meeting Edith le Mentier. She
had dressed very sweetly to welcome him,
and looked very young and pathetic. It
was so late that he scolded her for sitting up
for him, but she told him she had something
special to say, and took him into the library,
shutting the door. The fire gleamed cheerily,
and Jack, as he leaned back in a big
arm-chair, and looked at the pretty, eager
face opposite him, felt more of a brute than
ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have had Muriel with me all the afternoon,”
she began nervously, “and she made
me promise to talk it all over frankly with
you. She’s been so good to me, Jack!—and
I told her that I would——” She hesitated,
and looked at the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could see that her lips trembled, and
a sudden longing to take her in his arms
and comfort her came over him, as he had
done one short year ago in the Indian garden.
But he did not—it was some time
since he had done so. And there was this
evening’s terrible barrier in between.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know, Jack, we haven’t been
married quite a year, and yet we aren’t very
happy, are we? I’m afraid I have been
terribly to blame, Jack. I wanted to tell
you so long ago, but you didn’t—didn’t
seem to care a bit. Then you began to see
such a lot of that horrible woman, and I
hated that, and I thought I hated you!
People told me I ought to amuse myself, and
that there were other men besides neglectful
husbands—and Major Kennedy, he’s a great
friend of yours, and he came so often to the
house—and you never seemed to care. Indeed,
I don’t believe you ever took the
trouble to find out, and I was very miserable
and silly! I daresay being miserable should
have made me wise, but you were the highest
thing I loved, and <span class='it'>still</span> love, Jack, and
you didn’t care!” She paused a moment,
catching her breath, and he grew white in a
sudden agony of fear and pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had lived with this woman—she was
his wife! He had married her a young,
untried girl, and he had given her the key
to all the dangers, and left her to face them
alone. He dared not interrupt her, and so
he waited, fearing each heavy, silent moment
as it passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wanted love, and he—he said he loved
me, Jack! Ah! don’t speak! I was a fool
and worse! but indeed I didn’t understand,
and then—Muriel came,”—he drew
in a deep breath, it might have been a
sob of relief,—“and I tried to be different.
Do you remember that night, two weeks
ago, when you came in late and I kissed
you, and you—laughed at me? Oh, Jack,
how it hurt me! And then the next day
he told me he would sell his soul for a kiss.
Perhaps he didn’t mean anything, but you
had gone to tea with Edith le Mentier, and
I—let him, Jack!” He started forward,
but she stopped him by a gesture. “Wait
till I finish, please,” she said. “Then I
understood, and I sent him away, and cried
all the afternoon. He wanted me to run
away with him, and I was weak and
frightened. I don’t know what I should
have done if it hadn’t been for Muriel.
You said I wasn’t truthful, so I want to be
quite truthful now. I think if it hadn’t
been for Muriel I should have gone. I
wanted to hurt your pride if I couldn’t win
your love; but Muriel stood by me, and
wouldn’t let me go. She told me what to
say to Major Kennedy. I’m not sure—but
I believe she said something to him herself—anyway
he went off somewhere at once.
Oh, Jack, <span class='it'>can’t</span> you love me! can you ever
be good to me again?” She lifted up her
arms towards him, with the tears rolling
down her cheeks. She was weak and irresolute,
vain and foolish, but he had done
nothing to help her, yet she had gone
through what had defeated him, and she
was asking him whether he could forgive
her! “I loved you, Jack,” she cried piteously;
“I loved you all the time! And it’s
all over now for ever and ever!” The color
rushed into her face and a new look came
into her eyes—a look he did not understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you say it’s all over?” he asked
dully. “It may happen again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will never come again,” she said, “because—oh,
Jack, I—I’m afraid, but I’m
very glad too—it’s always so wonderful, and
don’t you understand?” she covered her
face with her hands, “I am going to be—the
mother of your child!” At last it
came to him, and for ever killed the irresponsibility
of love’s selfishness. He took
her now in his arms, he dared to do so,
because now for him too the other was all
over. She was helpless and clinging, she
was his wife, and she was going into the
valley of the shadow of death because
she loved him. “Oh, Jack, will you forgive?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive you!” he cried, and tried to explain
to her how sorry he was, how much to
blame, and how glad at last that they both
of them understood, and how now it would
all be different—so wonderfully different!
But he did not tell her about Edith le
Mentier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she was safe in bed he wrote to the
other woman, and hurt her very bitterly.
The other woman, for all her faults, is very
often brave, and Edith le Mentier suffered
horribly; but she bore the great defeat, and
was only a very little irritable the next
morning. She did not sing Gounod’s
song again; she said it was scarcely
suitable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She always shrugged her shoulders and
smiled when people mentioned Jack’s wife,
and when they spoke of him she said “Poor
fellow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who could tell that those were the figures
of the sum called tragedy? Not the tragedy
of the true-hearted who see through pain
the vista of glory, but that inordinate agony
which because it is so solely selfish eats into
the heart that bears it, and for the vista
substitutes a <span class='it'>cul-de-sac</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack and Gladys went to his estate in the
country, where they spent some bad hours,
and learned lessons of tolerance. It was,
fortunately for Jack, the hunting season,
and he rode hard to hounds. Gladys cultivated
the country people, read a great deal,
and took an intelligent interest in Jack’s
“runs.” At the end of the time they could
live together quite comfortably, and avoided
the unendurable with the ready forbearance
of quite long married people. The knowing
what to avoid is the key to most things,
though it is often difficult to turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A son was born to them, making Jack
a proud father, and consequently a good
husband. And Gladys found a life more
engrossing than her own. She wrote and
asked Muriel to stand godmother.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote20em'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“Life’s business being just the terrible choice.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>There</span> was trouble at Shindies Alley, not
that there was anything unusual in that!
For it was a place where trouble was the
commonplace, and what the comfortable
call tragedy almost a nursery rule. Only
the trouble was worse than usual, amounting
to the prospect of the police and a possible
murder case in the papers. “Rough
Tom” being not quite so drunk as usual had
beaten his wife nearly to death, a thing he
had done before, but never quite so effectually.
It was better, the neighbors thought,
to send a boy to the doctor’s, he and the
lady at the club had been there before.
This time the doctor arrived first. “Rough
Tom” was off, no one of course knew where.
All denied any knowledge of him, though
exultingly willing to report any unnecessary
and loathsome details of the row.
The doctor dismissed the crowd curtly.
They vanished silently into dark holes and
corners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a cold night. The children sharing
the den where their mother lay cursing and
groaning cried dismally. They also cried
loudly; it seemed worth while with both a
row and a doctor. Geoff despatched them
to a neighbor’s across the passage, and
examined the woman by a guttering candle.
She swore horribly, but she was too much
engrossed with pain to be afraid; she was
also anxious to explain that it was not her
man’s fault but another woman’s, whom she
called by a variety of names. She was too
ill to be moved, and the doctor began with
steady gentleness to dress the wounds. He
needed a nurse, but he had no time to send
for one. The case was urgent. We fight
as earnestly for the most apparently useless
lives as for the dearest, yet we cannot
believe that God has as high a respect
for the ultimate fate of the crushed soul’s
life as we have to keep breath in a ruined
body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the doctor’s profession, but it was
that least of all that made him fight for her.
He looked up and saw Muriel at the door.
He felt intensely angry that she should
know such a place existed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should advise you to go away,” he said
coldly. Muriel looked up for a moment,
simply astonished, then she advanced towards
him and the heap of rags.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to help you,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are only in the way,” he replied
grimly, not raising his eyes from the patient.
“I want a nurse, not—a young lady.” The
last words might have been an insult. She
flushed angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can hold her for you,” she said; “I
am not afraid.” It was necessary to have
some help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will faint?” he questioned incredulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Dr. Grant, I shall not!” said Muriel.
He knew by her tone that she was very
angry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, don’t waste any more time,”
was his only reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another moment she was down on her
knees, obeying short, imperious orders. Dr.
Grant never left much to the initiative of his
nurses. The sight was almost more repulsive
than she could bear. She wanted to
cover her face with her hands instead of using
them on the awful crushed form. She
wanted to scream at the woman’s pain, to
rage at the doctor’s cruelty, to fly from this
whole world of constant reiterated woe; but
she was far too angry even to let her hands
tremble. At last she felt that her strength
was going; she turned white, cold perspiration
stood on her forehead. The doctor
glanced at her sharply, and then—he
laughed. The hot blood rushed to her
heart; she grew rigid now, but not with fear;
the noise in her ears ceased. She heard
every word he said, anticipated every need,
and had not reached the limit of her strength
when the doctor released her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The morphia will keep her quiet till
morning,” he said. “You’d better go
home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will she live?” she asked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unfortunately—yes,” said Geoff. “Women
of that sort generally do—to be beaten
again!” They went in silence to the door.
Muriel was quite certain now that she disliked
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geoff left a few parting directions to a
reluctant, but almost entirely sober, neighbor.
When they were in the street Muriel
waited for him to explain; but he did not
explain. It was a habit of his not to,
possibly owing to his professional desire to
steer clear of the definite. Muriel was too
astonished, hurt and indignant to remain
silent for long. She stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night, Dr. Grant,” she said with
an icy formality. The doctor’s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?” he asked. She
looked at him with a searching angry glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your manner has not pleased me to-night,”
she replied quietly; “I should prefer
to return alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry if I have displeased you,
Miss Dallerton,” said Geoff with his mouth
ominously twitching. Was it imaginable
that she couldn’t see he wanted to kiss
her? As she stood there, aggrieved, defiant,
serious, her eyes like two points of light
under her heavy hair, the bright color in her
cheeks, the whole daring absurdity of <span class='it'>her</span>
seriously facing life there in a horrible alley
instead of the delicate luxury of a West-End
drawing-room, he could have laughed at the
inappropriateness of it. “It’s too cold for
an apology,” he ventured more gravely. “I
will see you about this later, if I may.
Please let me see you home first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not want to seem girlishly tempestuous,
so she assented to his last request,
but in bitter silence walked with him to the
club. She did not give him her hand as he
said “Good-night.” She wanted tremendously
to refuse to allow him to call, to cut
short their acquaintance, to never set eyes
on him again. But she felt an absurd desire
to cry brought on by the physical strain of
the past two hours, so that she said nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet when she was in her room she would
not cry. She forced the tears back, and
remembered how he had laughed at her!
The utter careless brutality of his whole
behavior! And Cynthia could be so foolish
as to imagine he cared for her! She herself
had never for an instant dreamed it—she
refused to admit it—it was impossible! It
never occurred to her in the least that Geoff
had been trying to rouse her courage
through opposition, and to control his own
too tender feelings by a mask of rudeness.
Even if it had occurred to her she would
probably have been just as angry, for what
she was really indignant with was his
strength and her weakness, and she could
find no excuses for that.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> studio lamps made cheerful colors in
the right places, and Cynthia feeling the
world as far as she was concerned in her
lap, in the shape of a baby boy, round and
fair with undecided features, felt that life
had brought its own rewards, richly, wonderfully.
She was almost afraid, she was so
happy, with the fear of those who have gone
into the darkness, and dreamt only of the
light. Leslie Damores was painting her
again, but the face was different. It was
called “Motherhood,” and it told of the
great need satisfied. Muriel was coming in
to see the picture. The studio door opened
and a woman come into the room; she was
little, and French, and beautifully dressed.
She advanced towards Cynthia with a little
cry; then she laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Cynthia, you’ve got a baby! I
told them to let me come right up. I was
an old friend, and I just had to come. Oh,
there’s your husband!” She turned with
another rapid laugh towards Leslie. He was
looking bravely at his wife, whose face was
strained and anxious; the woman seemed
evidently nervous too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’re very silent you two,” she
cried defiantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want?” said Cynthia
coldly. “I thought you had gone away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so I did, and I’ve come back.
Clifton died, and I married again. Did you
know it?—an American too—and he didn’t
give me any peace till I promised to get
Launcelot. We Americans seem to have
such horrid consciences.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You never had, had you?” said Cynthia
quietly. The woman looked angry, then
she laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I guess you’re about right—I
never had much trouble that way; but
when Sam Hicks wanted Launcelot I felt it
would be right sweet to take him back with
us to America, and I had the greatest time
finding your address. You’re fixed up real
genteel, Mr. Damores; I should think you
must have made painting pay. And is
that Cynthia’s picture? How perfectly
lovely!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Hicks,” said Cynthia slowly—“I
think I understood you to say that was
your husband’s name—when you let me
take Launcelot three years ago I had no
idea you would ever claim him again. He
has just gone to school here in England. He
is very happy——” Cynthia’s voice broke.
“Oh, why do you want him again?” she
cried—“it’s cruel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to have my boy,” said Mrs.
Hicks raising her voice. “I tell you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A moment,” Leslie Damores broke in.
“You were last heard of running away with
a French Count. Do you think you are a
fit person to take care of a child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, how dare you?” she cried, facing
him with frightened rage; “I declare I
never heard the like! I’ll have you up for
libel, Mr. Leslie Damores; and, as for you,
Mrs. Leslie Damores——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am speaking for my wife, and you may
speak to me,” said Leslie, “otherwise you
leave the room.” Mrs. Hicks began to cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And to think that I am respectably
married and everything. But that’s what
it is, a poor woman must always suffer
for her mistakes, while as for you—you can
have as many of them as you like, and
you’re none the worse for them!” She
stopped again; their silence checked her,
she felt hushed by their quiet contempt; and
yet, angrier than ever, “I’m the boy’s
mother,” she said turning to Cynthia; “how
would you like to have your child taken
from you?” Cynthia looked helplessly at
her husband; the woman had touched the
right plea; she was the boy’s mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall see Launcelot to-morrow, Mrs.
Hicks,” said Leslie, “and by that time I
shall have inquired into your case, and if
your assertions are true as to your husband
and his means of support we will consider
the matter. Meanwhile there is nothing
more to be said, and if you will allow me
I will take you downstairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Hicks looked spitefully at Cynthia,
but Leslie’s face checked her—the baby had
begun to cry. She flung up her head and
left the room. The baby had gone, and
Cynthia was crying alone in the studio
when he came back. He took her in his
arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Leslie,” she moaned, “he meant
everything to us, dear little fellow. Do you
remember he made me good again, and he
found you for me? Leslie, I can’t let him
go back to her. She left him so cruelly.
He is mine, darling—tell me I needn’t let
him go—he’s such a delicate little fellow.
Oh, I can’t! I can’t!” He stroked her hair;
she had never cried since her marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dearest, we will leave it to him. She
is his mother—we mustn’t forget that. She
has some claim on him, after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You could threaten to tell her husband
about—about the Count,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, no, no,” said Leslie gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t mean it, dear—I didn’t mean
it,” she sobbed afresh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will go and bring Launcelot,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t that baby crying?” It was not
baby crying, but she turned and fled upstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all,” said Leslie thoughtfully,
“she’s not Launcelot’s mother.” Then he
went out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel came in to find the studio empty
of everything but the great picture of
“Motherhood.” The woman holding Paradise
in her arms stung her to the quick with
her expression of ineffable content. She
was not looking at the child in her arms.
She was holding it too close to need the
reassurance of a glance; she was looking
across the child with all the loves in her
eyes, steady and beautiful and bright, eyes
too happy to smile. Muriel knew suddenly
that it was the way Cynthia looked at her
husband. She did not wish to see them
then, so slowly she let the curtain down
before the picture and crept softly out of
the room. But the woman’s eyes followed
her home, and when she was in the club and
back in her room she saw them still. They
seemed to have a quiet wonder in them that
any woman could ever dream that there was
any other happiness than that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something is surely wrong when one
begins to count up one’s blessings,” said
Muriel. “My life is full—full of everything
I want!” But as she looked defiantly in
the glass she saw she had not got the
woman’s look in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Launcelot and Leslie walked hand in hand
very solemnly home through the streets of
London. Leslie had been trying to explain.
Launcelot’s little face was very white, but
he would not cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think—do you think I ought to
leave you and Lady Beautiful and—and
baby?” he asked wistfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is your mother, dear boy, and she
wants you very much,” said Leslie reproaching
himself for the coldness in his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And are mothers everything?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mothers are a very great deal, old
fellow. You see you belong to them—you’re
their very own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I suppose so,” said the little fellow
wearily. “Baby is Lady Beautiful’s very
own, and so are you, but I’m not to be any
more.” There was a quiver in his voice.
Leslie pressed his little hand, he felt too
much to speak. “My mother didn’t want
me very much for her very own before, did
she? You see she gave me to Lady
Beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She wants you now,” said Damores
hoarsely. They were very near home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I don’t think I want her very much,
you know,” said Launcelot wistfully. “But
they didn’t give me any choice, did they,
when they made me belong to her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think they thought she needed you;
you see she has no one else but a new
husband,” Leslie explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I must go,” said Launcelot as
Leslie opened the door, “because you see a
new husband can’t be much, and a boy who
belongs to you must mean more, I should
think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am quite sure that a boy who belongs
to you means much more,” said Leslie kissing
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was all settled before Launcelot
ever saw Lady Beautiful. They looked a
little nervously at each other as the door
opened and they saw her sitting by the fire.
She sprang up with a little sudden cry and
her arms held out to him. He had been to
school and knew that fellows never cry, but
he had only just learnt it—and he forgot.
Leslie watched them for a moment sobbing
in each other’s arms. The tenderness and
pity from her new rich store made her seem
more wonderful than ever to him. His
heart ached at their grief, but the woman’s
assertions were true—the child must go.
The inevitable had to him a consolation. He
went and smoked hard in the studio. To
Cynthia it was a cage, and she struggled in
vain against the bars, crying over Launcelot
as he slept at last, with troubled
breathing from his late sobs. But when
the baby cried she went to it again. The
next morning Mrs. Hicks appeared. She was
nervously anxious to please. She called
Launcelot by all the affectionate names
she could think of, but he only looked at
her with half-frightened, wondering eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now Launcelot will come with
mother?” she asked at last. He looked
wistfully back at Cynthia and her husband,
his heart breaking. Parting with the baby
had been gone through upstairs. He had
cried till he could cry no more, so he only
looked at them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would rather belong to you, Lady
Beautiful,” he whispered, as she put her
arms about him, “much, much rather belong
to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She watched him walk with his mother
down the street, her face pressed to the
panes. When he reached the corner he
turned and waved back to her. His
mother gave his arm a little pull, and he
did not turn again. It was the last time
Cynthia ever saw him. He went out of
her life as suddenly and strangely as he
had entered it; but in the meantime the
broken thread had been joined together
again, the dreams she had resolutely crushed
had blossomed in a garden of reality, and
the great power of love had filled up what
had been the emptiness and desolation of
her soul.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XL</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote20em'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“How Love is the only good in the world.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Now</span> I have come to make my apologies,
Miss Dallerton,” said the doctor in a cheery
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a cold day, and he looked aggressively
warm and reassuring. He never
needed to be made allowances for, and
Muriel could never quite forgive him that.
She had made so many allowances for Jack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid you thought me a little short
with you the other day—in fact, you were
so displeased you had half a mind to walk
through Stepney by yourself—now, hadn’t
you?” he asked smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were very rude to me the other
day, Dr. Grant, and though you seem to
take my forgiveness for granted, you have
not yet given me any explanation.” The
doctor laughed, but his eyes grew colder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well!” he said, “so you won’t forgive
me without?” Muriel frowned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you have a reason I should like to
hear it,” she suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor walked once or twice up and
down the room. She watched him unwillingly;
he had the most splendid shoulders;
she did not think he could be more than
thirty-six. Then he stopped before her chair
and looked at her very gravely. He was so
tall that she felt at a disadvantage; some
instinct made her rise too, and they stood
there face to face, their eyes doing battle.
She looked away at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” she questioned. She was conscious
that her breath was coming quickly,
and she thanked Heaven she didn’t blush
easily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was short to you,” said the doctor
deliberately, “because it seemed to me the
only way of getting help from you. If I
hadn’t made you thoroughly angry you
would probably have fainted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should not have fainted,” she said,
her eyes flashing fiercely. She knew she
was not speaking the truth, but it was too
desperately difficult. If she submitted in
one thing, where would they stop? She
was beginning to lose her self-control and
her sense of proportion at the same time.
It is dangerous for a man to lose both,
but it is fatal to a woman to lose
either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was another reason,” said the
doctor slowly. Muriel was silent. “Do
you want to hear it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If——” she began icily. “Yes, I may
as well hear it,” she finished in confusion.
She did not want him to think she cared
enough to be angry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love you!” he said with the same
quiet deliberation and a pause between
each word, “and it was a little difficult to
let you help in any other way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room grew suddenly tense; each
breath was a terrible sword which shook the
universe; there seemed an awful conspiracy
in the room to win some concession; the
very chairs and table seemed to wait and
listen. A hand-organ in the street clanged
them back into facts again. The doctor,
still looking at her, picked up a paper-knife;
Muriel sank back into the chair. There
seemed nothing left in the world to say,
but she felt as if there might be if he would
only keep still a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very sorry,” she said at last, and
then she could have bitten her tongue out,
it sounded so commonplace. She noticed
that he was looking suddenly very tired, but
he smiled with grave eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew you would be,” he said, “and I
must go and make some calls. But you do
understand now, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I do,” said Muriel; “but are
you going away?” He almost laughed at
her thoughtlessness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well! yes, Miss Dallerton,” he said; “I
think I must go now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muriel rose to her feet, and a great wave
of desolation swept over her. She stood
there alone, and before her eyes passed
the vision of those who had left her—Alec—Jack—Cynthia—her
uncle. All with
their different lives, their different circles.
And now he was going, the friend who
had made life and her work, her youth
and her beauty so excellently well worth
while—with whom she had argued, quarrelled
and discussed—and he was leaving
her. All of a sudden she knew she could
not bear it—that she, too, needed help and
comfort and sympathy—that though one
may give all and prosper, yet it is blessed to
receive as well. And then he looked so
tired. He was waiting for her to dismiss
him, and he could not understand why she
was keeping him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want you to go,” said Muriel at
last. “I’m sure I need you more—more
than the other patients, only you must
learn to ask questions and not to make
assertions only if you want me to be a satisfactory
case!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What made you say that you were
sorry?” he asked her after a long, wonderful
pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was sorry,” she laughed at him, “that
you didn’t tell me so before!”</p>

<hr class='tbk101'/>

<p class='pindent'>When Jack heard of her marriage he
shrugged his shoulders. “I always thought
she would run <span class='it'>amôk</span> on some sort of a professional
chap, but I rather thought it
would be a parson,” he said, and thought
how much better she might have done for
herself if she had only known when she had
a good thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought she was cut out for an old
maid,” Edith le Mentier told her friends;
“but those sort of women generally marry
and have fourteen children.”</p>

<hr class='tbk102'/>

<p class='pindent'>It mattered very little to Muriel what was
said. She looked at things now with the
eyes of the woman in Damores’ picture; and
she and Geoff having found so much for
themselves were the more anxious to give
their sunshine to the world. They believed
that the purposes of love, in human and
material things, were the channels through
which the spirit finds soaring room—never
apart from earth, but ever nearer heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their one need left was to join the gospel
of example, which is simply loving everything
for love’s sake, whether it visibly love
back or no. To acquaintances they seemed
to have positively left the world, but they
themselves knew that they had found the
true one.</p>
